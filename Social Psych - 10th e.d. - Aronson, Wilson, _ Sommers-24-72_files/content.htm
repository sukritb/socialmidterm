guides as we take you on a journey through the world of social psychology. As we embark on this journey, our hope is to convey our excitement about social psychology—what it is and why it matters. Not only do we, the authors, enjoy teaching this stuff (which we’ve been doing, combined, for more than 100 years), we also love contributing to the growth and development of this field. In addition to being teachers, each of us is a scientist who has contributed to the knowledge base that makes up our discipline. Thus, not only are we leading this tour, we also helped create some of its attractions. We will travel to fascinating and exotic places like prejudice, love, propaganda, education, conformity, aggression, compassion… all the rich variety and surprise of human social life. Ready? OK, let’s go!</p><p style="padding-left: 189pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">Let’s begin with a few examples of the heroic, touching, tragic, and puzzling things that people do:</p><ul id="l1"><li data-list-text="•"><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 207pt;text-indent: -12pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.karmatube.org/videos.php?id=1606" class="a" target="_blank">Jorge Munoz is a school bus driver during the day but works a different “job” at night: Feeding the hungry.

To do so, social psychologists focus on the influence other people have on us. More for- mally, <b>social psychology </b>is the scientific study of the way in which people’s thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are influenced by the</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="468" height="320" alt="image" src="Image_005.jpg"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">real or imagined presence of other people (Allport, 1985). When we think of social in- fluence, the kinds of examples that readily come to mind are direct attempts at persua- sion, whereby one person deliberately tries to change another person’s behavior or atti- tude. This is what happens when advertisers use sophisticated techniques to persuade us to buy a particular brand of deodorant, or when our friends try to get us to do some- thing we don’t really want to do (“Come on, have another beer!”), or when the bullies use force or threats to get what they want.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">The study of direct attempts at <b>social influence </b>is a major part of social psychol- ogy and will be discussed in our chap- ters on conformity, attitudes, and group processes.

For example, your close friends would like you to do one thing (for e.g., watching a movie), but your romantic partner would like you to do something entirely different (for</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 123%;text-align: justify;">e.g., going out for dinner). Have you found yourself in such situations in which conflicting pressures from your partner versus your friends? How do you decide how to act in these situations?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 189pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">our thoughts and feelings as well as our overt acts, and takes many forms other than deliberate attempts at persuasion. For example, we are often influenced merely by the <span class="s23">presence </span>of other people, including perfect strangers who are not interacting with us. Other people don’t even have to be present: We are governed by the imaginary approval or disapproval of our parents, friends, and teachers and by how we expect others to react to us. Sometimes these influences conflict with one another, and social psycholo- gists are especially interested in what happens in the mind of an individual when they do. For example, conflicts frequently occur when young people go off to college and find themselves torn between the beliefs and values they learned at home and the beliefs and values of their professors or peers. (See the Try It! above) We will spend the rest of this introductory chapter expanding on these issues, so that you will get an idea of what so- cial psychology is, what it isn’t, and how it differs from other, related disciplines.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s24" style="padding-left: 189pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 84%;text-align: left;">Social Psychology, Philosophy, Science, and Common Sense</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 189pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Throughout history, philosophy has provided many insights about human nature. Indeed, the work of philosophers is part of the foundation of contemporary psychol- ogy. Psychologists have looked to philosophers for insights into the nature of con- sciousness (e.g., Dennett, 1991) and how people form beliefs about the social world (e.g., Gilbert, 1991). Sometimes, however, even great thinkers find themselves in dis- agreement with one another. When this occurs, how are we supposed to know who is right?</p><p style="padding-left: 189pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">We social psychologists address many of the same questions that philosophers do, but we attempt to look at these questions scientifically—even questions concerning that great human mystery, love. In 1663, the Dutch philosopher Benedict Spinoza of- fered a highly original insight. In sharp disagreement with the hedonistic philosopher Aristippus, he proposed that if we fall in love with someone whom we formerly hated, that love will be stronger than if hatred had not preceded it. Spinoza’s proposition was beautifully stated, but that doesn’t mean it is true. These are <span class="s23">empirical </span>questions, mean- ing that their answers should be derived from experimentation or measurement rather than by personal opinion (Aronson, 1999; Wilson, 2015).</p><p style="padding-left: 189pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">Now let’s take another look at the examples that opened this chapter. Why did these people behave the way they did? One way to answer would simply be to ask them. We could ask Jorge Munoz why he spends so much time and money feeding the poor; we could ask the people who observed Abraham Biggs’s suicide why they didn’t call the police; we could ask Oscar why he enjoys fraternity life. The problem with this approach is that people are often unaware of the reasons behind their own responses and feelings (Nisbett &amp; Wilson, 1977; Wilson, 2002). People might come up with plenty of justifications for not calling the police to rescue Biggs, but those justifications might not be the <span class="s23">reason </span>they did nothing.</p><p style="padding-left: 189pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">Another approach is to rely on common sense or folk wisdom. Social psycholo- gists are not opposed to folk wisdom—far from it. The primary problem with relying</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 61pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;"><a name="bookmark4">&zwnj;</a>Introducing Social Psychology <span class="h4">27</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 61pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">entirely on such sources is that they often disagree with one another. Consider what folk wisdom has to say about the factors that influence how much we like other peo- ple. We know that “birds of a feather flock together.” Of course, we say, thinking of the many examples of our pleasure in hanging out with people who share our backgrounds and interests. But folk wisdom also tells us—as it persuaded lovestruck Kristen— that “opposites attract.” Of course, we say, thinking of all the times we were attracted to people with different backgrounds and in- terests. Well, which is it? Similarly, are we to believe that “out of sight is out of mind” or that “absence makes the heart grow fonder”? Social psychologists would suggest that there are some conditions under which birds of a feather do flock together, and other con- ditions under which opposites do attract. Similarly, in some conditions absence does make the heart grow fonder, and in others “out of sight” does mean out of mind. But it’s not enough to say both proverbs can be</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="468" height="289" alt="image" src="Image_007.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">NATO-led soldiers inspect the site of a suicide attack in Afghanistan. What causes a person to become a suicide bomber? Popular theories say such people must be mentally ill, alienated loners, or psychopaths. But social psychologists would try to understand the circumstances and situations that drive otherwise healthy, well-</p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">educated, bright people to commit murder and suicide for the sake of a religious or political goal.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">true. Part of the job of the social psychologist is to do the research that specifies the</p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">conditions <span class="p">under which one or another is most likely to take place.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark49" class="a">Thus, in explaining why two people like each other—or any other topic of interest—social psychologists would want to know which of many possible explana- tions is the most likely. To do this, we have devised an array of scientific methods to test our assumptions, guesses, and ideas about human social behavior, empirically and systematically rather than by relying on folk wisdom, common sense, or the opin- ions and insights of philosophers, novelists, political pundits, and our grandmothers. Doing experiments in social psychology presents many challenges, primarily because we are attempting to predict the behavior of highly sophisticated organisms in com- plex situations. As scientists, our goal is to find objective answers to such questions as: What are the factors that cause aggression? What causes prejudice, and how might we reduce it? What variables cause two people to like or love each other? Why do certain kinds of political advertisements work better than others? In Chapter </a>2 we discuss the scientific methods social psychologists use to answer questions such as these.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s24" style="padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 84%;text-align: left;">How Social Psychology Differs From Its Closest Cousins</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Social psychology is related to other disciplines in the physical and social sciences, including biology, neuroscience, sociology, economics, and political science. Each ex- amines the determinants of human behavior, but important differences set social psy- chology apart—most notably in its level of analysis. For biologists and neuroscientists, the level of analysis might be genes, hormones, or physiological processes in the brain. Although social psychologists sometimes draw on this approach to study the relation- ship between the brain and social behavior, their emphasis is, as we will see, more on how people interpret the social world.</p><p style="padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">Other social psychologists draw on the major theory of biology—evolutionary theory—to generate hypotheses about social behavior. In biology, evolutionary theory is used to explain how different species acquired physical traits, such as long necks.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">28 <span class="s6">Chapter 1</span></h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Evolutionary Psychology</p><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 128%;text-align: left;">The attempt to explain social behavior in terms of genetic fac- tors that have evolved over time according to the principles of natural selection</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In an environment where food is scarce, giraffes that happened to have long necks could feed on foliage that other animals couldn’t reach. These giraffes were more likely to survive and reproduce offspring than were giraffes with shorter necks, the story goes, such that the “long neck” gene became dominant in subsequent generations.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="p">But what about social behaviors, such as the tendency to be aggressive toward a member of one’s own species or the tendency to be helpful to others? Is it possible that social behaviors also have genetic determinants that evolve through the process of natural selection, and if so, is this true in human beings as well as other animals? These are the questions posed by </span><span class="s17">evolutionary psychology</span><span class="p">, which attempts to explain social behavior in terms of genetic factors that have evolved over time according to the prin- ciples of natural selection. The</span><span class="s25" style=" background-color: #FFF066;"> core idea is that evolution occurs very slowly, such that </span></p><p style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s25" style=" background-color: #FFF066;"> social behaviors that are prevalent today, such as aggression and helping behavior, are </span></p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: -1pt;text-align: right;"><span class="s25" style=" background-color: #FFF066;"> a result, at least in part, of adaptations to environments in our distant past </span><span class="p"> (Brown &amp; Cross, 2017; Buss, 2005; Neuberg, Kenrick, &amp; Schaller, 2010). We will discuss in upcom- ing chapters how evolutionary theory explains social behavior (e.g., Chapter 10 on in- terpersonal attraction, Chapter 11 on prosocial behavior, and Chapter 12 on aggression). We note here that a lively debate has arisen over the testability of evolutionary hypotheses. Because current behaviors are thought to be adaptations to environmental conditions that existed thousands of years ago, psychologists make their best guesses about what those conditions were and how specific kinds of behaviors gave people a reproductive advantage. But these hypotheses are obviously impossible to test with the experimental method. And just because hypotheses sound plausible does not mean they are true. For example, some scientists now believe that giraffes did not acquire a long neck to eat leaves in tall trees. Instead, they suggest, long necks first evolved in male giraffes to gain an advantage in fights with other males over access to females (Simmons &amp; Scheepers, 1996). Which of these explanations is true? It’s hard to tell. Evolutionary explanations can’t be tested directly, because after all, they involve hypotheses about what happened thousands of years ago. They can, however, suggest novel hypotheses about why people do what they do in today’s world, which can then</span></p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">be put to the test, as we will see in later chapters.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">Well, if we aren’t going to rely solely on an evolutionary or biological approach, how else might we explain why people do what they do, such as in the examples that opened this chapter? If you are like most people, when you read these examples you assumed that the individuals involved had some weaknesses, strengths, and personality traits that led them to respond as they did. Some people are leaders and others are followers; some people are public-spirited and others are selfish; some are brave and others are cowardly. Perhaps the people who failed to get help for Abraham Biggs were lazy, timid, selfish, or heartless. Given what you know about their behavior, would you loan them your car or trust them to take care of your new puppy?</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">Explaining people’s behavior in terms of their traits is the work of personality psychologists, who generally focus on <span class="s23">individual differences</span>, that is, the aspects of peo- ple’s personalities that make them different from others. Research on personality in- creases our understanding of human behavior, but social psychologists believe that explaining behavior primarily through personality traits ignores a critical part of the story: the powerful role played by social influence.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">Consider again the tragedy at Jonestown. Remember that it was not just a hand- ful of people who committed suicide there, but almost 100% of them. It is highly im- probable that they were all mentally ill or had the same constellation of personality traits. If we want a richer, more thorough explanation of this tragic event, we need to understand what kind of power and influence a charismatic figure like Jim Jones pos- sessed, the nature of the impact of living in a closed society cut off from other points of view, and other factors that could have caused mentally healthy people to obey him. In fact, as social psychologists have shown, the social conditions at Jonestown were such</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 61pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;"><a name="bookmark5">&zwnj;</a>Introducing Social Psychology <span class="h4">29</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">that virtually anyone—even strong, nonde- pressed individuals like you or us—would have succumbed to Jones’s influence.</p><p style="padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">Here  is  a  more  mundane  exam- ple. Suppose you go to a party and see a great-looking fellow student you have been hoping to get to know better. The student is looking uncomfortable, however—standing alone, not making eye contact, not talking to anyone who comes over. You decide you’re not so interested; this person seems pretty aloof, even arrogant. But a few weeks later you see the student again, now being super social and witty, the center of attention. So what is this person “really” like? Aloof and arrogant or charming and welcoming? It’s the wrong question; the answer is both and neither. All of us are capable of being shy in some situations and outgoing in others. A much more interesting question is: What factors were different in these two situations that had such a profound effect on the stu- dent’s behavior? That is a social psychologi- cal question. (See the Try It!)</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">For personality and clinical psycholo- gists, the level of the analysis is the individ-</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="468" height="363" alt="image" src="Image_008.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Personality psychologists study qualities of the individual that might make a person shy, conventional, rebellious, and willing to wear a turquoise wig in public or a yellow shirt in a sea of blue. Social psychologists study the powerful role of social influence on how all of us behave.</p><p style="padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">ual. For the social psychologist, the level of analysis is the individual in the context of a social situation—particularly the individual’s <b>construal </b>of that situation. The word <span class="s23">con- strual</span>, which means how people perceive, comprehend, and interpret the social world, is a favorite among social psychologists, because it conveys how important it is to get inside people’s heads and understand how they see the world, and how those constru- als are shaped by the social context. For example, to understand why people intention- ally hurt one another, the social psychologist focuses on how people construe a specific social situation: Do they do so in a way that makes them feel frustrated? Does frustra- tion always precede aggression? If people are feeling frustrated, under what conditions will they vent their frustration with an aggressive act and under what conditions will they restrain themselves? (See Chapter 12.)</p><p style="padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">Other social sciences are more concerned with social, economic, political, and his- torical factors that influence events.

Sociologists study the group or institution; social psychologists study the influence of those groups and institutions on individual behavior.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">focuses on such topics as social class, social structure, and social institutions. Of course, because society is made up of collections of people, some overlap is bound to exist be- tween the domains of sociology and those of social psy- chology. The major difference is that in sociology, <span class="s23">the level of analysis is the group, institution, or society at large</span>, whereas the level of analysis in social psychology is the individual within a group, institution, or society. So although sociol- ogists, like social psychologists, are interested in causes of aggression, sociologists are more likely to be concerned with why a particular society (or group within a society) produces different levels of violence in its members. Why is the murder rate in the United States so much higher than in Canada or Europe? Within the United States, why is the murder rate higher in some geographic regions than in others? How do changes in society relate to changes in aggressive behavior?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="389" height="310" alt="image" src="Image_010.jpg"/></span></p><p style="padding-bottom: 3pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">Social psychology differs from other social sciences not only in the level of analysis, but also in what is being</p><div class="textbox" style="background:#FFEF66;display:block;min-height:22.0pt;width:248.0pt;"><p class="s26" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">explained. <span class="s27">The goal of social psychology is to identify psy-</span></p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">chological properties that make almost everyone susceptible</p></div><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#FFEF66;display:block;min-height:9.0pt;width:248.0pt;"><p class="s27" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">to social influence, regardless of social class or culture. <span class="s26">The</span></p></div><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;"/><div class="textbox" style="background:#FFEF66;display:block;min-height:9.0pt;width:138.0pt;"><p class="s26" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">laws governing the relationship</p></div><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 141pt;text-align: left;">between frustration and aggression, for example, are hypothesized to be true of</p><p style="padding-left: 189pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">most people in most places, not just members of one gender, social class, culture, age group, or ethnicity.</p><p style="padding-left: 189pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark49" class="a">However, because social psychology is a young science that developed mostly in the United States, some of its findings have not yet been tested in other cultures to see if they are universal. Nonetheless, our goal is to discover such laws. And increasingly, as methods and theories developed by American social psychologists are adopted by European, Asian, African, Middle Eastern, and South American social psychologists, we are learning more about the extent to which these laws are universal, as well as cul- tural differences in the way these laws are expressed, as well as cultural influences on how people interpret the social world (see </a>Chapter 2). <span class="s23">Cross-cultural research </span>is there- fore extremely valuable, because it sharpens theories, either by demonstrating their universality or by leading us to discover additional variables that help us improve our understanding and prediction of human behavior. We will offer many examples of cross-cultural research in this book.</p><p style="padding-left: 189pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark17" class="a">In sum, social psychology is located between its closest cousins, sociology and per- sonality psychology (see Table </a>1.1). Social psychology and sociology share an interest in the way the situation and the larger society influence behavior. Social psychology and personality psychology share an interest in the psychology of the individual. But social psychologists work in the overlap between those two disciplines: They empha- size the psychological processes shared by most people around the world that make them susceptible to social influence.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 189pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="475" height="1" alt="image"

people explain and interpret events, as well as their own and others’ behavior.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Suppose you go to a restaurant with a group of friends. The server comes over to take your order, but you are having a hard time deciding which pie you want. While you are hesitating, she impatiently taps her pen against her notepad, rolls her eyes toward the ceiling, scowls at you, and finally snaps, “Hey, I haven’t got all day!” Like most people, you would probably think that she is a nasty or unpleasant person.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">But suppose, while you are deciding whether to complain about her to the man- ager, a regular customer tells you that your “crabby” server is a single parent who was kept awake all night by the moaning of her youngest child, who was terribly sick; that her car broke down on her way to work and she has no idea where she will find the money to have it repaired; that when she finally arrived at the restaurant, she learned that her coworker was too drunk to work, requiring her to cover twice the usual num- ber of tables; and that the short-order cook keeps screaming at her because she is not picking up the orders fast enough. Given all that information, you might now con- clude that she is not a nasty person but an ordinary human under enormous stress.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">This small story has huge implications. Most Americans will explain someone’s behavior in terms of personality; they focus on the fish, and not the water the fish swims in. The fact that they fail to take the situation into account has a profound im- pact on how human beings relate to one another—such as, in the case of the server, whether they feel sympathy and tolerance or impatience and anger.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark7">&zwnj;</a>32 <span class="s6">Chapter 1</span></h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">Fundamental Attribution Error <span class="s19">The tendency to overestimate the extent to which people’s behavior</span></p><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">is due to internal, dispositional</p><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 128%;text-align: left;">factors and to underestimate the role of situational factors</p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s24" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Underestimating the Power of the Situation</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The social psychologist is up against a formidable barrier known as the <b>fundamental attribution error</b>, which is the tendency to explain our own and other people’s be- havior entirely in terms of personality traits and to underestimate the power of social influence and the immediate situation. We are going to give you the basics of this phe- nomenon here, because you will be encountering it throughout this book.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="p">Explaining behavior in terms of personality can give us a feeling of false secu- rity. When people try to explain repugnant or bizarre behavior, such as the people of Jonestown taking their own lives and killing their own children, they find it tempting and, in a strange way, comforting to write off the victims as flawed human beings. Doing so gives them the feeling that it could never happen to them. Ironically, this way of thinking </span><span class="s25" style=" background-color: #FFF066;"> actually increases our vulnerability to destructive social influences </span></p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: -1pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s25" style=" background-color: #FFF066;"> by making us less aware of our own susceptibility to them. </span><span class="p">Moreover, by failing to fully appreciate the power of the situation, we tend to o</span><span class="s25" style=" background-color: #FFF066;">versimplify the problem, </span></p><p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s25" style=" background-color: #FFF066;"> which can lead us to blame the victim in situations where the individual was over</span><span class="p">-</span></p><p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s25" style=" background-color: #FFF066;"> powered by social forces too difficult for most of us to resist, as in the Jonestown </span></p><p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s25" style=" background-color: #FFF066;"> tragedy. </span></p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">To take a more everyday example, imagine a situation in which two people are playing a game and they must choose one of two strategies: They can play competi- tively and try to win as much money as possible and make sure their partner loses as much as possible, or they can play cooperatively and try to make sure they both win some money. How do you think each of your friends would play this game?</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">Few people find this question hard to answer; we all have a feeling for the rel- ative competitiveness of our friends. Accordingly, you might say, “I am certain that my friend Jennifer, who is a hard-nosed business major, would play this game more competitively than my friend Anna, who is a soft-hearted, generous person.” But how accurate are you likely to be? Should you be thinking about the game itself rather than who is playing it?</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">To find out, researchers at Stanford University conducted the following experiment (Liberman, Samuels, &amp; Ross, 2004). They described the game to resident assistants (RAs) in a student dorm and asked them to come up with a list of undergrads whom they thought were either especially cooperative or especially competitive. As expected, the RAs easily identified students who fit each category. Next, the researchers invited these students to play the game in a psychology experiment. There was one added twist: The researchers varied a seemingly minor aspect of the social situation—what the game was called. They told half the participants that they would be playing the Wall Street Game and the other half that they would be playing the Community Game. Everything else about the game was identical. People who were judged as either competitive or coop- erative played a game that was called either the Wall Street Game or the Community Game, resulting in four conditions: cooperative people playing the Wall Street Game, cooperative people playing the Community Game, competitive people playing the Wall Street Game, or competitive people playing the Community Game.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark18" class="a">Again, most of us go through life assuming that what really counts is an individual’s true character, not something about the individual’s immediate situation and certainly not something as trivial as what a game is called, right? Not so fast! As you can see in Figure </a>1.1, the name of the game made a tremendous difference in how people behaved. When it was called the Wall Street Game, approximately two-thirds of the students responded competitively; when it was called the Community Game, only a third responded competitively. The name of the game sent a powerful message about how the players should behave. But a student’s alleged personality trait made no measurable difference in the student’s behavior.

Suppose you are a seventh-grade history teacher. In one of your classes, you structure the learning experience so that it resembles the situa- tion implied by the term “Wall Street Game.” You encourage competition, you tell your students to raise their hands as quickly as possible and to jeer at any incorrect answers given by other students. In your other class, you structure the learning situation such that the students are rewarded for cooperating with one another, for listening well, for encouraging one another and pulling together to learn the material. What do you suppose the effect these different situations might have on the performance of your students, on their enjoyment of school, and on their feelings about one another? Such an experiment will be discussed in Chapter 13 (Aronson &amp; Patnoe, 2011).</p><p style="padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">Of course personality differences do exist and frequently are of great importance, but social and environmental situations are so powerful that they have dramatic ef- fects on almost everyone.

(See Chapter 10.) However, because the early behaviorists did not concern themselves with cognition, thinking, and feeling—concepts they con- sidered too vague and mentalistic and not sufficiently anchored to observable behavior—they overlooked phenomena that are vital to the human social experi- ence. Most especially,</p><div class="textbox" style="background:#FFEF66;display:block;min-height:9.0pt;width:58.0pt;"><p class="s27" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">environments.</p></div><p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="104" height="12" alt="image" src="Image_023.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">For social psychologists, people’s behavior is not influenced directly by the sit- uation but rather, as we mentioned earlier, by their construal of it (Griffin &amp; Ross, 1991; Ross &amp; Nisbett, 1991).

What do you see in that figure? Do you see a duck looking to the left or a rabbit looking the right? Objectively it is neither; rather, it is how you are <span class="s23">construing </span>it at any particular point in time. That is, according to Gestalt psychology, one must focus on the phe- nomenology of the perceivers—on how an object appears to them—instead of on its objective components.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">The Gestalt approach was formulated by German psychologists in the first part of the twentieth century. In the late 1930s, several of these psychologists fled to the United States to escape the Nazi regime. Among the émigrés was Kurt Lewin, gen- erally considered the founding father of modern experimental social psychology. As a young German Jewish professor in the 1930s, Lewin experienced the anti-Semitism rampant in Nazi Germany. The experience profoundly affected his thinking, and once he moved to the United States, Lewin helped shape American social psychology, di- recting it toward a deep interest in exploring the causes and cures of prejudice and ethnic stereotyping.</p><p style="padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">As a theorist, Lewin took the bold step of applying Gestalt principles beyond the perception of objects—such as the duck/rabbit picture above—to how we perceive the social world. It is often more important to understand how people perceive, compre- hend, and interpret each other’s behavior, he said, than it is to understand its objective properties (Lewin, 1943). “If an individual sits in a room trusting that the ceiling will not come down,” he said, “should only his ‘subjective probability’ be taken into ac- count for predicting behavior or should we also consider the ‘objective probability’ of the ceiling’s coming down as determined by engineers? To my mind, only the first has to be taken into account” (p. 308).</p><p style="padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">Social psychologists soon began to focus on the importance of how people con- strue their environments. Fritz Heider (1958), another early founder of social psy- chology, observed, “Generally, a person reacts to what he thinks the other person is perceiving, feeling, and thinking, in addition to what the other person may be doing” (p. 1). We are busy guessing all the time about the other person’s state of mind, motives, and thoughts. We may be right—but often we are wrong.</p><p style="padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">That is why construal has major implications. In a murder trial, when the pros- ecution presents compelling evidence it believes will prove the defendant guilty, the verdict always hinges on precisely how each jury member construes that evidence. These construals rest on a variety of events and perceptions that often bear no objec- tive relevance to the case. During cross-examination, did a key witness come across as being too remote or too arrogant? Did the prosecutor appear to be smug, obnox- ious, or uncertain?</p><p style="padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">A special kind of construal is what Lee Ross calls <b>naïve realism</b>, that is, the con- viction that we perceive things “as they really are,” underestimating how much we are interpreting or “spinning” what we see. People with opposite political views, for example, often can’t even agree on the facts; both sides think that they are “seeing as it really is,” when in fact both are probably letting their beliefs color their interpretation of the facts. We tend to believe, therefore, that if other people see the same things dif- ferently, it must be because <span class="s23">they </span>are biased (Ehrlinger, Gilovich, &amp; Ross, 2005; Pronin, Gilovich, &amp; Ross, 2004; Ross, 2010). Ross has been working closely with Israeli and Palestinian negotiators who are trying to resolve the decade’s long conflict between Israel and Palestine. These negotiations frequently run aground because of naïve real- ism; each side assumes that other reasonable people see things the same way they do. “[E]ven when each side recognizes that the other side perceives the issues differently,” says Ross, “each thinks that the other side is biased while they themselves are objec- tive and that their own perceptions of reality should provide the basis for settlement” (Ross, 2010). So both sides resist compromise, fearing that their “biased” opponent will benefit more than they.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="184" height="248" alt="image" src="Image_027.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s44" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Kurt Lewin (1890–1947).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Naïve Realism</p><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 128%;text-align: left;">The conviction that we perceive things “as they really are,” under- estimating how much we are inter- preting or “spinning” what we see</p><h4 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark9">&zwnj;</a>36 <span class="s6">Chapter 1</span></h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Research by social psychologists on construal shows why negotiation between nations can be so difficult: Each side thinks that it sees the issues clearly but that the other side is “biased.”</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">In a simple experiment, Ross took peace proposals created by Israeli nego- tiators, labeled them as Palestinian pro- posals, and asked Israeli citizens to judge them. The Israelis liked the Palestinian pro- posal attributed to Israel more than they liked the Israeli proposal attributed to the Palestinians. Ross (2010) concludes, “If your own proposal isn’t going to be attractive to you when it comes from the other side, what chance is there that the <span class="s23">other </span>side’s proposal is going to be attractive when it comes from the other side?” The hope is that once negotiators on both sides become fully aware of this phenomenon and how it impedes conflict resolution, a reasonable compromise will be more likely.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="468" height="335" alt="image" src="Image_028.jpg"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">You can see that construals range from the simple (as in the question “How do you see it?”) to the remarkably complex (inter- national negotiations). And they affect all of us in our everyday lives. Imagine that Jason is a college student who admires Maria from afar. As a budding social psychologist, you</p><p style="padding-left: 188pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">have the job of predicting whether or not Jason will ask Maria to have dinner with him. To do this, you need to begin by viewing Maria’s behavior through Jason’s eyes—that is, by seeing how Jason interprets her behavior. If she smiles at him, does Jason construe her behavior as mere politeness, the kind of politeness she would extend to any of the dozens of nerds and losers in their class? Or does he view her smile as an encouraging sign that inspires him to ask her out? If she ignores him, does Jason figure that she’s playing hard to get, or does he take it as a sign that she’s not interested in him? To pre- dict what Jason will do, it is not enough to know Maria’s behavior; we must know how Jason construes her behavior. But how are these construals formed? Stay tuned.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="681" height="348" alt="image" src="Image_029.png"/></span></p><p class="s21" style="padding-top: 23pt;padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">#trending</p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Medals for Sustainability!</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 123%;text-align: justify;">Countries have time and again recognized the power of construal in getting their citizens to interpret proposed initiatives in a favorable light by putting positive labels on initiatives they wish to implement. Recently, Japan, the host country of the 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games, introduced the “Tokyo 2020 Medal Project” as the official “Nationwide Participation Programme” and promised the world to deliver the “most innovative Olympic games ever organized”. The ingenious idea of using precious metals extracted from used or discarded electronics to create the Olympic medals was soon revealed and collections toward this project started in April 2017. In a span of two years, the citizens of the country willfully donated approximately 6.21 million used mobile phones and other electronics, which in turn also saved Japan millions in operating costs. With a total of 1,621 municipalities participating in this initiative, over 5,000 gold, silver, and bronze medals were</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 123%;text-align: justify;">produced using 100 percent of the metals contributed by the people of Japan.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 18pt;line-height: 123%;text-align: justify;">The obvious explanation for this successful recycling effort is related to how the Japanese construed these solicitations by the authorities who hoped that this initiative would raise awareness about the amount of e-waste generated annually all around the world. Instead of publicizing the donation drive in dull formal statements, the “Everyone’s Medal” program was promoted as a community effort which would enable Japanese citizens to contribute to the Games and a successful hosting of the event in a much more personal manner. As a result, the campaign boasted of a 90 percent nationwide participation rate, which further went to prove how a tiny tweak in communication can bolster an altered construal and ultimately one’s willingness to help.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 61pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;"><a name="bookmark10">&zwnj;</a>Introducing Social Psychology <span class="h4">37</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="681" height="414" alt="image" src="Image_030.png"/></span></p><p class="s21" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 84pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Review Questions</p><ol id="l11"><li data-list-text="1."><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 96pt;text-indent: -12pt;line-height: 122%;text-align: left;">You are crossing the road when a car jumps the red light and almost hits you.

If it is true that subjective and not objective situations influence people, we need to understand how people arrive at their subjective impressions of the world. What are people trying to accomplish when they interpret the social world? Are they concerned with making an interpretation that places them in the most positive light (e.g., Jason’s deciding that “Maria is ignoring me just to make me jealous”) or with making the most accurate interpretation, even if it is unflattering (e.g., “Painful as it may be, I must admit that she would rather go out with a sea slug than with me”)? Social psychologists seek to understand the fundamental motives that determine why we construe the social world the way we do.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="324" height="12" alt="image" src="Image_031.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">We human beings are complex organisms. At any given moment, various inter- secting motives underlie our thoughts and behaviors, including hunger, thirst, fear, a desire for control, and the promise of love and other rewards. (See Chapters 10 and 11.) Social psychologists emphasize the importance of two central motives in steering peo- ple’s construals: <span class="s23">the need to feel good about ourselves </span>and <span class="s23">the need to be accurate. </span>Sometimes, each of these motives pulls us in the same direction. Often, though, these motives tug us in opposite directions, where to perceive the world accurately requires us to admit that we have behaved foolishly or immorally.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">Leon Festinger, one of social psychology’s most innovative theorists, realized that it is precisely when these two motives pull in opposite directions that we can gain our most valuable insights into the workings of the mind. To illustrate, imagine that you are the president of the United States and your country is engaged in a difficult and costly war. You have poured hundreds of billions of dollars into that war, and it has</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="184" height="236" alt="image" src="Image_032.gif"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Leon Festinger (1919–1989) wrote: “If the empirical world looks complicated, if people seem to react in bewilderingly different ways to similar forces, and if</p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I cannot see the operation of universal underlying dynamics, then that is</p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">my fault. I have asked the wrong questions; I have, at a theoretical level, sliced up the world incorrectly. The underlying dynamics are there, and I have to find the theoretical apparatus that will enable me to reveal these uniformities” (Festinger, 1980, p.</p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">246). Finding and illuminating those underlying dynamics is the goal of social psychology.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark11">&zwnj;</a>38 <span class="s6">Chapter 1</span></h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="385" height="225" alt="image" src="Image_033.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This is Edward Snowden, a former computing contractor for the National Security Agency. Snowden’s release in 2013 of thousands of classified documents related</p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">to the U.S. government’s surveillance programs led the Department of Justice to charge him with espionage. Some have argued that Snowden is a spy, a traitor, and a criminal who should be brought back to the United States from his asylum in Russia to face trial. Others view him as a whistle-blower, a patriot, and a hero fighting to protect privacy rights and inform the American public of what its government is up to (in fact, here you see him pictured receiving a German peace prize, a prize he was only able to accept via Skype). Each side is sure that they are right.

The war seems to be at a stalemate; no end is in sight. You frequently wake up in the middle of the night, bathed in the cold sweat of conflict: On the one hand, you deplore all the carnage that is going on; on the other hand, you don’t want to go down in history as the first American president to lose a war.</p><p style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">Some of your advisers tell you that they can see the light at the end of the tunnel, and that if you intensify the bombing or add thousands more troops, the enemy will soon capitulate and the war will be over. This would be a great outcome for you: Not only will you have succeeded in achiev- ing your military and political aims, but history will consider you to have been a great leader as well. Other advisers, however, believe that inten- sifying the bombing will only strengthen the ene- my’s resolve; they advise you to sue for peace.</p><p style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">Which advisers are you likely to believe? President Lyndon Johnson faced this exact di- lemma in the 1960s, with the war in Vietnam; so did George W. Bush in 2003, when the war in Iraq</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Self-Esteem</p><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 128%;text-align: left;">People’s evaluations of their own self-worth—that is, the extent to which they view themselves as good, competent, and decent</p><p style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">did not end in 6 weeks as he had predicted; so did Barack Obama and Donald Trump, in 2009 and 2017, respectively, in deciding whether to invest more troops in the war in Afghanistan. Most presidents have chosen to believe their advisers who suggest esca- lating the war, because if they succeed in winning, the victory justifies the human and financial cost; but withdrawing not only means going down in history as a president who lost a war, but also having to justify the fact that all those lives and all that money have been spent in vain. As you can see, the need to feel good about our decisions can fly in the face of the need to be accurate, and can have catastrophic consequences (Draper, 2008; McClellan, 2008; Woodward, 2010). In Johnson’s case, the decision to increase the bombing <span class="s23">did </span>strengthen the enemy’s resolve, thereby prolonging the war in Vietnam.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s24" style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 84%;text-align: left;">The Self-Esteem Motive: The Need to Feel Good About Ourselves</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Most people have a strong need to maintain reasonably high <b>self-esteem</b>—that is, to see themselves as good, competent, and decent (Aronson, 1998, 2007; Baumeister, 1993; Tavris &amp; Aronson, 2007). Given the choice between distorting the world to feel good about themselves and representing the world accurately, people often take the first option. They put a slightly different spin on the matter, one that puts them in the best possible light. You might consider your friend Roger to be a nice guy but an awful slob—somehow he’s always got stains on his shirt and empty food cartons all over his kitchen. Roger, though, probably describes himself as being casual and “laid back.”</p><p style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">Self-esteem is obviously a beneficial thing, but when it causes people to justify their actions rather than learn from them, it can impede change and self-improvement. Suppose a couple gets divorced after 10 years of a marriage made difficult by the husband’s irrational jealousy. Rather than admitting the truth—that his jealousy and possessiveness drove his wife away—the husband blames the breakup of his marriage on her; she was not responsive enough to his needs. His interpretation serves a pur- pose: It makes him feel better about himself (Simpson, 2010). The consequence of this distortion, of course, is that learning from experience becomes unlikely. In his next</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 61pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;"><a name="bookmark12">&zwnj;</a>Introducing Social Psychology <span class="h4">39</span><a name="bookmark13">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">marriage, the husband will probably recreate the same problems. Acknowledging our deficiencies is difficult, even when the cost is failing to learn from our mistakes.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">SUFFERING AND SELF-JUSTIFICATION <span class="p">Moreover, the</span></p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">need to maintain our self-esteem can have paradoxical ef- fects. Let’s go back to one of our early scenarios: Oscar and the hazing he went through to join his fraternity. Personality psychologists might suggest that only extraverts who have a high tolerance for embarrassment would want to be in a fraternity. Behavioral psychologists would predict that Oscar would dislike anyone or anything that caused him pain and humiliation. Social psychologists, however, have found that the major reason that Oscar and his fellow pledges like their fraternity brothers so much was <span class="s23">because </span>of the degrading hazing rituals.</p><p style="padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">Here’s how it works. Suppose Oscar freely chose to go through a severe hazing to become a member of the fraternity but later discovers unpleasant things about his fraternity brothers. If he were completely honest with himself he would conclude, “I’m an idiot; I went through all of that pain and embarrassment only to live in a house with a bunch of jerks.” But saying “I’m an idiot” is not exactly the best way to maintain one’s self-esteem, so in- stead Oscar puts a positive spin on his situation. “My fra-</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="389" height="266" alt="image" src="Image_034.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">These first-year students are being “welcomed” to their university by seniors who subject them to hazing. Hazing is sometimes silly, but it is often dangerous as well (and even fatal), leading college campuses to crack down on the practice. One difficulty faced by such efforts is that for all of its downsides, hazing can also build group cohesiveness. Does this explanation sound far-fetched? In Chapter 6 we will see a series</p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">of laboratory experiments that indeed show that people often come to love what they suffer for.</p><p style="padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">ternity brothers aren’t perfect, but they are there when I need them and this house sure has great parties.” He justifies the pain and embarrassment of the hazing by viewing his fraternity as positively as he can.</p><p style="padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">An outside observer like his sister Janine, however, can see the downside of fraternity life more clearly. The fraternity dues make a significant dent in Ocar’s budget, the frequent parties take a toll on the amount of studying he can do, and consequently his grades suffer. But Oscar is motivated to see these negatives as trivial; indeed, he considers them a small price to pay for the sense of brother- hood he feels. He focuses on the good parts of living in the fraternity, and he dismisses the bad parts as inconsequential.</p><p style="padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">The take-home message is that human beings are motivated to maintain a posi- tive picture of themselves, in part by justifying their behavior, and that under certain specifiable conditions, this leads them to do things that at first glance might seem surprising or paradoxical. They might prefer people and things for whom they have suffered to people and things they associate with ease and pleasure.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s24" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 19pt;text-align: left;">The Social Cognition Motive:</p><p class="s24" style="padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 19pt;text-align: left;">The Need to Be Accurate</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Even when people are bending the facts to see themselves as favorably as they can, most do not live in a fantasy world. After all, it would not be advisable to sit in our rooms thinking that it’s simply a matter of time before we become a movie star, lead singer in a rock band, the best player on a World Cup soccer team, or President of the United States, all the while eating, drinking, and smoking as much as we want because surely we will live to be 100. We might say that people bend reality but don’t completely break it. Yes, we try to see ourselves in a favorable light, but we are also quite good at scoping out the nature of the social world. That is, we are skilled at <b>social cognition</b>, which is the study of how people select, interpret, remember, and use information to make judgments and decisions (Fiske &amp; Taylor, 2017; Markus &amp;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Social Cognition</p><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 128%;text-align: left;">How people think about themselves and the social world; more specifically, how people select, interpret, remember, and use social information to make judgments and decisions</p><h4 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">40 <span class="s6">Chapter 1</span></h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We rely on a series of expectations and other mental short-cuts in making judgments about the world around us, from important life decisions to which cereal to buy at the store, a conclusion with which advertisers and marketers are very well aware.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="248" height="285" alt="image" src="Image_035.jpg"/></span>	<span><img width="217" height="287" alt="image" src="Image_036.jpg"/></span></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#FFEF66;display:block;min-height:9.0pt;width:152.0pt;"><p class="s26" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">who investigate processes of social</p></div><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><div class="textbox" style="background:#FFEF66;display:block;min-height:9.0pt;width:50.0pt;"><p class="s26" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">Researchers</p></div><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Zajonc, 1985; Nisbett &amp; Ross, 1980).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><div class="textbox" style="background:#FFEF66;display:block;min-height:9.0pt;width:362.0pt;"><p class="s26" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">cognition begin with the assumption that all people try to view the world as accurately</p></div><p style="padding-bottom: 4pt;padding-left: 189pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;"/><div class="textbox" style="background:#FFEF66;display:block;min-height:9.0pt;width:362.0pt;"><p class="s26" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">as possible.

People are not perfect in their effort to under- stand and predict, because they almost never know all the facts they need to judge a given situation completely accurately. Whether it is a relatively simple decision, such as which breakfast cereal offers the best combination of healthfulness and tastiness, or a slightly more complex decision, such as our desire to buy the best car we can for under $20,000, or a much more complex decision, such as choosing a partner who will make us deliriously happy for the rest of our lives, it is usually impossible to gather all the relevant information in advance. Moreover, we make countless decisions every day. No one has the time and stamina to gather all the facts for each of them.</p><p style="padding-left: 188pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">Does this sound overblown? Aren’t most decisions fairly easy? Let’s take a closer look. Which breakfast cereal is better for you, Lucky Charms or Quaker Granola with oats and raisins? If you are like most of our students, you answered, “Quaker Granola.” After all, Lucky Charms is a kids’ cereal, full of sugar and cute little marshmallows, with a picture of a leprechaun on the box. Quaker Granola cereal boxes have pictures of healthy granola and fruit, and doesn’t <span class="s23">natural </span>mean “good for you”? If that’s the way you reasoned, you have fallen into a common cognitive trap: You have gener- alized from the cover to the product.

But why do we want to understand social influence in the first place? What difference does it make whether our behavior has its roots in the desire to be accurate or to bolster our self-esteem?</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">The basic answer is simple: We are curious. Social psychologists are fascinated by human social behavior and want to understand it on the deepest possible level. In a sense, all of us are social psychologists. We all live in a social environment, and we are all more than mildly curious about such issues as how we become influenced, how we influence others, and why we fall in love with some people, dislike others, and are indifferent to still others. You don’t have to be with people literally to be in a social environment. Social media is a social psychologist’s dream laboratory because it’s all there: love, anger, bullying, bragging, affection, flirting, wounds, quarrels, friending and unfriending, pride and prejudice.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">Many social psychologists have another reason for studying the causes of social behavior: to contribute to the solution of social problems. This goal was present at the founding of the discipline. Kurt Lewin,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="468" height="301" alt="image" src="Image_039.jpg"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">having barely escaped the horrors of Nazi Germany, brought to the United States his passionate interest in understanding how the transformation of his country had hap- pened. Ever since, social psychologists have been keenly interested in their own contem- porary social challenges, as you will discover reading this book. Their efforts have ranged from reducing violence and prejudice to in- creasing altruism and tolerance (Chapters 11 and 13). They study such pressing issues as how to induce people to conserve natural resources like water and energy, practice safe sex, or eat healthier food (Chapter 7). They study the effects of violence in the media (Chapter 12). They work to find ef- fective strategies to resolve conflicts within groups—whether at work or in juries—and</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">between nations (Chapter 9). They explore ways to raise children’s intelligence through environmental interventions and better</p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Social psychology can help us study social problems and find ways to solve them. Social psychologists might study whether children who watch violence on television become more aggressive themselves—and, if so, what kind of intervention might be beneficial.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark15">&zwnj;</a>42 <span class="s6">Chapter 1</span></h4><p style="padding-top: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="395" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_040.png"/></span></p><p class="s46" style="padding-left: 350pt;text-indent: -311pt;line-height: 72%;text-align: left;">Watch <span class="s47">WHY IS SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY IMPORTANT?                  </span><span class="p">school programs, and reduce the high school dropout rate of minority students.

For in- terested readers, we have included three final chapters on health, the environment, and law. We hope that by understanding the funda- mental causes of behavior as social psycholo- gists study them, you will also be better able to change your own self-defeating or misguided behavior, improve your relationships, and make better decisions.</p><p style="padding-left: 188pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">We are now ready to begin our tour of social psychology in earnest. So far, we have been emphasizing the central theme of social psychology: the enormous power of most social situations. As researchers, our job is to ask the right questions and to find a way to capture the power of the social situation and bring it into the laboratory for detailed study. If we are adept at doing that, we will arrive at truths about human behavior that are close to being universal. And then we may be able to bring our laboratory findings into the real world—for the ultimate betterment of our society.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="684" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_042.png"/></span></p><p class="s48" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Summary</p><p class="s49" style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 78pt;text-indent: -39pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: justify;">LO 1.1 <span class="s50">Define social psychology and distinguish it from other disciplines.</span></p><ul id="l21"><li data-list-text="•"><p class="s17" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: -12pt;text-align: justify;">Defining Social Psychology <span class="p">Social psychology is de- fined as the scientific study of the way in which peo- ple’s thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are influenced by the real or imagined presence of other people.

One survey found that 46% of men and 16% of women between the ages of 18 and 39 looked at pornography in the past week (Regnerus, Gordon, &amp; Price, 2016). Another found that a quarter of all employees who have access to the internet visit porn sites during their workdays (“The Tangled Web of Porn,” 2008). It is thus important to ask whether exposure to pornography has harmful effects. Is it possible, for example, that looking at graphic sex increases the likelihood that men will become sexually violent?</p><p style="padding-left: 189pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">Over the past several decades there has been plenty of debate about the right answer to these questions. Legal scholar Catharine MacKinnon (1993) argued that “Pornography is the perfect preparation—motivator and instruction manual in one— for … sexual atrocities” (p. 28). In 1985, a group of experts, appointed by the attorney general of the United States, voiced a similar opinion, concluding that pornography is a cause of rape and other violent crimes. But in 1970, another commission reviewed much of the same evidence and concluded that pornography does <span class="s23">not </span>contribute significantly to sexual violence. Who are we to believe? Is there a scientific way to determine the answer? We believe there is, and in this chapter we will discuss the kinds of research methods social psychologists employ, using research on pornography as an example.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 189pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Social Psychology: An Empirical Science</p><p class="s16" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 189pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">LO 2.1  <span class="s17">Describe how researchers develop hypotheses and theories.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 188pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A fundamental principle of social psychology is that many social problems, such as the causes of violence, can be studied scientifically (Reis &amp; Gosling, 2010; Reis &amp; Judd, 2000; Wilson, Aronson, &amp; Carlsmith, 2010). Before we discuss how social psychologi- cal research is done, we begin with a warning: The results of some of the experiments you encounter will seem obvious because social psychology concerns topics with which we are all intimately familiar—social behavior and social influence (Richard, Bond, &amp;</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><u> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </u> Stokes-Zoota, 2001).

Indeed, there is a well-known human tendency called the <b>hindsight bias</b>, whereby after people know that something oc- curred, they exaggerate how much they could have predicted it before it occurred (Bernstein, Aßfalg, Kumar, &amp; Ackerman, 2016; Davis &amp; Fischhoff, 2014; Ghrear, Birch, &amp; Bernstein, 2016; Knoll &amp; Arkes, 2016). After we know the winner of a political election, for example, we begin to look for reasons why that candidate won. After the fact, the outcome seems more easily predictable, even if we were quite unsure who would win before the election. The same is true of findings in psychology experiments; it seems like we could have easily predicted the outcomes—after we know them. The trick is to predict what will happen in an experiment before you know how it turned out. To illustrate that not all obvious findings are easy to predict, take the Try It! quiz above.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hindsight Bias</p><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 128%;text-align: left;">The tendency for people to exaggerate, after knowing that something occurred, how much they could have predicted it before it occurred</p><h4 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark23">&zwnj;</a>48 <span class="s6">Chapter 2</span><a name="bookmark24">&zwnj;</a><a name="bookmark25">&zwnj;</a></h4><p style="padding-top: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s24" style="padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Formulating Hypotheses and Theories</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">How, then, do social psychologists come up with the ideas for their studies? Research begins with a hunch, or hypothesis, that the researcher wants to test. There is lore in science that holds that brilliant insights come all of a sudden, as when the Greek scholar Archimedes shouted, “Eureka! I have found it!” when the solution to a problem flashed into his mind. Although such insights do sometimes occur suddenly, science is a cumulative process, and people often generate hypotheses from previous theories and research.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">INSPIRATION FROM PREVIOUS THEORIES AND RESEARCH  <span class="p">Many stud-</span></p><p style="padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">ies stem from a researcher’s dissatisfaction with existing theories and explana- tions. After reading other people’s work, a researcher might believe that he or she has a better way of explaining people’s behavior. In the 1950s, for example,</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s25" style=" background-color: #FFF066;"> Leon Festinger was dissatisfied with the ability of a major theory of the day, be</span><span class="p">-</span></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s25" style=" background-color: #FFF066;"> haviorism, to explain why people change their attitudes. He formulated a new </span></p><p style="padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: -1pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s25" style=" background-color: #FFF066;"> approach—cognitive dissonance theory—tha</span><span class="p">t made specific predictions about when and how people would change their attitudes. As we will see in Chapter 6, other researchers were dissatisfied with Festinger’s explanation of the results he obtained, so they conducted further research to test other possible explanations. Social psychologists, like scientists in other disciplines, engage in a continual pro- cess of theory refinement: A theory is developed; specific hypotheses derived from that theory are tested; based on the results obtained, the theory is revised and new hypotheses are formulated.</span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">HYPOTHESES BASED ON PERSONAL OBSERVATIONS  <span class="p">Social psychology</span></p><p style="padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">also deals with phenomena we encounter in everyday life. Researchers often ob- serve something in their lives or the lives of others that they find curious and interesting, stimulating them to construct a theory about why this phenomenon occurred—and to design a study to see if they are right. In the early 1960s, for example, a tragic murder was committed in the Queens section of New York City that led to a major research area in social psychology. Kitty Genovese, a young woman returning to her apartment late one night in 1964, was brutally killed in an attack that lasted 45 minutes. The <span class="s23">New York Times </span>reported that 38 apartment residents either saw the attack from their windows or heard Genovese’s screams, and that no one attempted to help her, not even by calling the police. Although we know now that the <span class="s23">Times </span>exaggerated the number of eyewitnesses who did noth- ing (Cook, 2014; Pelonero, 2014), the story vividly captured public</p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In October of 2011, a 2-year-old girl was struck by two vans in a row. A dozen people walked or rode past her. Why didn’t they stop to help?</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">fears and, for its time, “went viral.” There is no doubt that bystand- ers often fail to help in emergencies (as we will see in Chapter 11), and the Genovese murder triggered a great deal of soul searching as to why. Some concluded that living in a metropolis dehumanizes us and leads inevitably to apathy, indifference to human suffering, and lack of caring.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="324" height="250" alt="image" src="Image_050.jpg"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">Bibb Latané and John Darley, two social psychologists who taught at universities in New York, had another idea. Instead of fo- cusing on “what was wrong with New Yorkers,” Latané and Darley thought it would be more interesting and important to examine the social situation in which Genovese’s neighbors found them- selves. Maybe, they thought, the more people who witness an emer- gency, the less likely it is that any given individual will intervene. Genovese’s neighbors might have assumed that someone else had called the police, a phenomenon Latané and Darley (1968) called the <span class="s23">diffusion of responsibility. </span>Perhaps the bystanders would have been more likely to help had each thought he or she alone was witness- ing the murder. How can we tell whether this hypothesis is true?</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 358pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark26">&zwnj;</a>Methodology: How Social Psychologists Do Research <span class="h4">49</span><a name="bookmark50">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="681" height="319" alt="image" src="Image_051.png"/></span></p><p class="s21" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 84pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Review Questions</p><ol id="l40"><li data-list-text="1."><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 96pt;text-indent: -12pt;line-height: 121%;text-align: left;">Why do some social psychology research findings seem like we could have predicted the results?</p><ol id="l41"><li data-list-text="a."><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 108pt;text-indent: -12pt;line-height: 122%;text-align: left;">Because we are not predicting.

There are three types of methods: the <span class="s23">observational method</span>, the <span class="s23">correlational method</span>, and the <span class="s23">experimental method </span><a href="#bookmark50" class="a">(see Table </a>2.1). Any of these methods could be used to explore a specific research question; each is a powerful tool in some ways and a weak tool in others. Part of the creativity in conducting social psycholog- ical research involves choosing the right method, maximizing its strengths, and mini- mizing its weaknesses.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">Here we discuss these methods in detail and try to provide you with a firsthand look at both the joy and the difficulty of conducting social psychological studies. The joy comes in unraveling the clues about the causes of interesting and important so- cial behaviors, just as a sleuth gradually unmasks the culprit in a murder mystery. Each of us finds it exhilarating that we have the tools to provide definitive answers to questions philosophers have debated for centuries. At the same time, as seasoned researchers, we have learned to temper this exhilaration with a heavy dose of humility, because there are formidable practical and ethical constraints involved in conducting social psychological research.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><table style="border-collapse:collapse;margin-left:63pt" cellspacing="0"><tr style="height:22pt"><td

class="s24" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 84%;text-align: left;">The Observational Method: Describing Social Behavior</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">There is a lot to be learned by being an astute observer of human behavior. If the goal is to describe what a particular group of people or type of behavior is like, the <b>observational method </b>is very helpful. This is the technique whereby a researcher observes people and records measurements or impressions of their behavior. The observational method may take many forms, depending on what the researchers are looking for, how involved or detached they are from the people they are observing, and how much they want to quantify what they observe.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s4">ETHNOGRAPHY  </span>One example of observational learning is <b>ethnography</b>, the method by which researchers attempt to understand a group or culture by observing it from the inside, without imposing any preconceived notions they might have. The goal is to un- derstand the richness and complexity of the group by observing it in action. Ethnography is the chief method of cultural anthropology, the study of human cultures and societies. As social psychology broadens its focus by studying social behavior in different cultures, ethnography is increasingly being used to describe different cultures and generate hy- potheses about psychological principles (Fine &amp; Elsbach, 2000; Flick, 2014; Uzzel, 2000).</p><p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">Consider this example from the early years of social psychological research. In the early 1950s, a small cult of people called the Seekers predicted that the world would come to an end with a giant flood on the morning of December 21, 1954. They were convinced that a spaceship from the planet Clarion would land in the backyard of their leader, Mrs. Keech, and whisk them away before the apocalypse. Assuming that the end of the world was not imminent, Leon Festinger and his colleagues thought it would be interesting to observe this group closely and chronicle how they reacted when their prophecy was disconfirmed (Festinger, Riecken, &amp; Schachter, 1956). To monitor the hour-to-hour conversations of this group, the social psychologists found it necessary to become members and pretend that they too believed the world was about to end. On the fateful morning of December 21, 1954, with no flood waters lapping at the door and no sign of a spaceship, they observed a curious thing: Rather than admitting that she was wrong, Mrs. Keech “doubled down” on her beliefs, announcing that God had spared Planet Earth because of the Seekers’ faith, and that it was now time for the group to go public and recruit more members. Based on his observations of Mrs. Keech’s tena- cious adherence to her beliefs, Festinger formulated one of the most famous theories in social psychology, cognitive dissonance, which we discuss in Chapter 6.</p><p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">The key to ethnography is to avoid imposing one’s preconceived notions on the group and to try to understand the point of view of the people being studied. Sometimes, how- ever, researchers have a specific hypothesis that they want to test using the observational method. An investigator might be interested, for example, in how much aggression chil- dren exhibit during school recesses. In this case, the observer would be systematically looking for particular behaviors that are concretely defined before the observation begins. For example, aggression might be defined as hitting or shoving another child, taking a toy from another child without asking, and so on. The observer might stand at the edge of the playground and systematically record how often these behaviors occur. If the researcher were interested in exploring possible sex and age differences in social behavior, he or she would also note the child’s gender and age. How do we know how accurate the observer is? In such studies, it is important to establish agreement between two or more people who independently observe and code a set of data. By showing that two or more judges independently come up with the same observations, researchers ensure that the observa- tions are not the subjective, distorted impressions of one individual.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s4">ARCHIVAL ANALYSIS  </span>The observational method is not limited to observations of real-life behavior. The researcher can also examine the accumulated documents, or archives, of a culture, a technique known as an <b>archival analysis </b>(Mannes, Soll, &amp;</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 358pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark30">&zwnj;</a>Methodology: How Social Psychologists Do Research <span class="h4">51</span><a name="bookmark31">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Larrick, 2014; Oishi, 2014). For example, diaries, novels, suicide notes, music lyrics, television shows, movies, magazine and news articles, advertising, social media, and the ways in which people use the internet all tell us a great deal about human behav- ior. One study, for example, analyzed millions of Twitter messages sent in 84 countries to examine daily rhythms in people’s mood. Judging by the content of the messages they send, most people’s positive moods appear to peak at two different times of the day: In the morning, soon after they get up, and late in the evening, before they go to bed (Golder &amp; Macy, 2011). Researchers have also used archival data to answer ques- tions about pornography usage. For example, do you think that people who live in some areas of the United States are especially likely to look at online pornography? Perhaps you guessed that it is those who live in more liberal “blue” states that are the biggest consumers, given that liberals tend to have more permissive attitudes toward social issues. To address this question, a researcher examined credit card subscriptions to pornography sites (Edelman, 2009). Although he was not given access to the names of people who subscribed, he did know their zip codes, which enabled him to estimate regional variations. As it turned out, residents of “blue” states and “red” were equally likely to subscribe to pornography sites (residents of Utah came in first).</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s4">LIMITS OF THE OBSERVATIONAL METHOD </span>The study that analyzed Twitter mes- sages revealed interesting daily patterns, but it did not say much about <span class="s23">why </span>moods peak in the morning and at night. Furthermore, certain kinds of behavior are difficult to ob- serve because they occur only rarely or only in private. You can begin to see the limita- tions of the observational method. Had Latané and Darley chosen this method to study the effects of the number of bystanders on people’s willingness to help a victim, we might still be waiting for an answer, given the infrequency of emergencies and the difficulty of predicting when they will occur. And, archival data about pornography, although in- formative about who is accessing it, tells us little about the effects on their attitudes and behavior of doing so. Social psychologists want to do more than just describe behavior; they want to predict and explain it. To do so, other methods are more appropriate.</p><p class="s24" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 84%;text-align: left;">The Correlational Method: Predicting Social Behavior</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A goal of social science is to understand relationships between variables and to be able to predict when different kinds of social behavior will occur.

People’s behavior and atti- tudes can be measured in a variety of ways. Just as with the obser- vational method, researchers sometimes make direct observations of people’s behavior. For example, researchers might be interested in testing the relationship between children’s aggressive behavior and how much violent television they watch. They too might observe chil- dren on the playground, but here the goal is to assess the relationship, or correlation, between the children’s aggressiveness and other factors, such as TV viewing habits, which the researchers also measure.</p><p style="padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">Researchers look at such relationships by calculating the <b>correlation coefficient</b>, a statistic that assesses how well you can predict one variable from another—for example, how well you can predict people’s weight from their height. A correlation coefficient can range from –1 to +1.

The correlation between people’s height and weight is about 0.7, for example, reflecting the fact that the taller people are, the more they tend to weigh. The relationship is strong but not perfect, which is why the correlation is less than 1. A negative correlation means that increases in the value of one variable are associated with decreases in the value of the other. If height and weight were negatively correlated in human beings, we would look very peculiar; short people, such as children, would look like penguins, whereas tall people, such as NBA basketball players, would be all skin and bones! It is also possible, of course, for two variables to be completely unrelated, so that a researcher cannot predict one variable from the other. In that case the correlation coefficient would be 0 (see </a>Figure 2.1).</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s4">SURVEYS  </span>The correlational method is often used to analyze the results of <b>surveys</b>, re- search in which a representative sample of people are asked questions about their attitudes or behavior. Surveys are a convenient way to measure people’s attitudes; for example, peo- ple can be telephoned and asked which candidate they will support in an upcoming elec- tion or how they feel about a variety of social issues. Psychologists often use surveys to help understand social behavior and attitudes—for example, by seeing whether the amount of pornography men say they read is correlated with their attitudes toward women.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">Surveys have a number of advantages, one of which is allowing researchers to judge the relationship between variables that are difficult to observe, such as how often people engage in safer sex. Another advantage is the ability to sample represen- tative segments of the population. The best way to do this is to use a <b>random selection </b>of people from the population at large, which is a way of ensuring that a sample of people is representative of a population by giving everyone in the population an equal chance of being selected for the sample. As long as the sample is selected randomly, and is reasonably large, we can assume that the responses are a reasonable match to those of the population as a whole.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">There are famous cases of surveys that yielded misleading results by failing to sam- ple randomly. In the fall of 1936, for example, a weekly magazine called the <span class="s23">Literary Digest </span>conducted a large survey asking people which candidate they planned to vote for in the upcoming presidential election. The magazine obtained the names and addresses of its sample from telephone directories and automobile registration lists. The results of its survey of 2 million people indicated that the Republican candidate, Alf Landon,</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="684" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_053.png"/></span></p><h3 style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Figure 2.1 <span class="s29">Types of Correlations</span></h3><p class="s32" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">The diagrams show three possible correlations in a hypothetical study of watching violence on television and aggressive behavior in children.

Of course, you know that there never was a President Landon; instead, Franklin Delano Roosevelt won every state in the Union but two. What went wrong with the <span class="s23">Literary Digest </span>poll? In the depths of the Great Depression, many people could not afford telephones or cars. Those who had them were doing well financially; most well-to-do voters were Republican and overwhelmingly favored Alf Landon. However, the majority of the voters were not well off—and overwhelmingly supported the Democratic candidate, Roosevelt. By using a list of names that excluded the less affluent members of the population, the <span class="s23">Literary Digest </span>surveyed a nonrepre- sentative sample. (the <span class="s23">Literary Digest </span>never recovered from this methodological disaster and went out of business shortly after publishing its poll.)</p><p style="padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">Modern political polls are not immune from such sampling errors. Many polling companies only contact people on their home phones (landlines), be- cause of the difficulty of obtaining directories of cell phone numbers. They do so at their peril, because research shows that Americans who rely solely on cell phones are more likely to vote for Democratic candidates (Silver, 2012). Further, pollsters adjust their results by estimating how likely respondents are to vote and applying other statistical corrections. These adjustments can introduce fur- ther bias, which may be why several polls underestimated the percentage of votes Donald Trump would receive in key swing states in the 2016 presidential election (Newkirk, 2016).</p><p style="padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">Another potential problem with survey data is the accuracy of the re- sponses. Straightforward questions, regarding who people intend to vote for or what they typically do, are relatively easy to answer. But asking survey par- ticipants to predict how they might behave in some hypothetical situation or to explain why they behaved as they did in the past is an invitation to inaccuracy (Schuman &amp; Kalton, 1985; Schwarz, Groves, &amp; Schuman, 1998). Often people simply don’t know the answer—but they think they do. Richard Nisbett and</p><p style="padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Tim Wilson (1977) demonstrated this “telling more than you can know” phe- nomenon in a number of studies in which people often made inaccurate reports about why they responded the way they did. Their reports about the causes of their responses pertained more to their theories and beliefs about what should have influenced them than to what actually influenced them. (We discuss these studies at greater length in Chapter 5.)</p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In the fall of 1936, a magazine called the <span class="s58">Literary Digest </span>predicted that the Republican candidate for president would win by a landslide, based on a poll they conducted.

found a correlation between the type of birth control women used and their likelihood of getting a sexually transmitted infection (STI). Those whose partners used condoms were more likely to have an STI than were women who used other forms of birth control. Does this mean that the use of condoms caused the increase in STIs? Not necessarily—see the text for alternative explanations of this research finding.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 73pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">LIMITS OF THE CORRELATIONAL METHOD: CORRELATION DOES</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="260" height="319" alt="image" src="Image_059.jpg"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 73pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s4">NOT EQUAL CAUSATION </span>The major shortcoming of the correlational method is that it tells us only that two variables are related, whereas the goal of the social psychologist is to identify the <span class="s23">causes </span>of social behavior.

For example, researchers have found a correlation between the amount of violent television children watch and how aggressive they are (similar to the pattern shown in the graph on the left side in Figure </a>2.1, though not quite as strong; see Eron, 2001). One explanation of this cor- relation is that watching TV violence causes kids to become more violent themselves. It is equally probable, however, that the reverse is true: that kids who are violent to begin with are more likely to watch violent TV. Or there might be no causal relationship between these two variables; in- stead, both TV watching and violent behavior could be caused by a third variable, such as having neglectful parents who do not pay much atten- tion to their kids. (Experimental evidence supports one of these causal relationships; we will discuss which one in Chapter 12.) When using the correlational method, it is wrong to jump to the conclusion that one vari- able is causing the other to occur. <span class="s23">Correlation does not prove causation.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">Unfortunately, forgetting this adage is one of the most common methodological er- rors in the social sciences. Consider a study of birth control methods and sexually trans- mitted infections (STIs) in women (Rosenberg, Davidson, Chen, Judson, &amp; Douglas, 1992). The researchers examined the records of women who had visited a clinic, noting which method of birth control they used and whether they had an STI. Surprisingly, the research- ers found that women who relied on condoms had significantly more STIs than women who used diaphragms or contraceptive sponges. This result was widely reported in the popular press, with the conclusion that the use of diaphragms and sponges caused a lower incidence of disease. Some news articles urged women whose partners used condoms to switch to other methods.</p><p style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">Can you see the problem with this conclusion? The fact that the incidence of dis- ease was correlated with the type of contraception women used is open to a number of causal interpretations. Perhaps the women who used sponges and diaphragms had sex with fewer partners. (In fact, condom users were more likely to have had sex with multiple partners in the previous month.) Perhaps the partners of women who relied on condoms were more likely to have STIs than were the partners of women who used sponges and diaphragms. There is simply no way of knowing. Thus, the conclusion that</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="394" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_060.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 170pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">the birth control methods protected against STIs cannot be drawn from this correlational study.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="394" height="224" alt="image" src="Image_061.png"/></span></p><p class="s38" style="padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">Revel Video</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s39" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 7pt;text-align: center;">Watch <span class="s40">SURVIVAL TIPS!

A recent summary of 22 studies, with more than 20,000 participants in seven coun- tries, found a correlation of 0.28 between looking at pornography and the likelihood of committing acts of sexual aggression (Wright, Tokunaga, &amp; Kraus, 2016). Remember what a correlation of</p><p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">0.28 means? Because it’s positive it means that the more pornography people consumed, the more likely they were to be sexually aggressive; though the relationship was not particularly strong.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">shooting frequently played a certain first-person shooter</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s6" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">video game.

That’s one of the possible explanations, but can you think of others? Perhaps the causal direction is the other way around—people who are prone to commit sexual violence are more interested in pornography; that is, it is their aggressiveness causing their attraction to pornography, and not the pornography causing their aggressiveness (Malamuth, Addison, &amp; Koss, 2000). Alternatively, there could be some third variable, such as something in people’s upbringing or subculture, that makes them more likely both to commit sexual violence and look at pornography. Other examples of the diffi- culty of inferring causality from correlational studies are shown in the following Try It!</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s24" style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 84%;text-align: left;">The Experimental Method: Answering Causal Questions</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The only way to determine causal relationships is with the <b>experimental method</b>. Here, the researcher systematically orchestrates the event so that people experience it in one way (e.g., they witness an emergency along with other bystanders) or another way (e.g., they witness the same emergency but are the sole bystander). The experi- mental method is the method of choice in most social psychological research, because it allows the experimenter to make causal inferences.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s4">INDEPENDENT AND DEPENDENT VARIABLES </span>To illustrate how this is done, let’s return to our previous example of Bibb Latané and John Darley, the two social psychol- ogists who came up with the diffusion of responsibility hypothesis, that the more peo- ple who witness an emergency, the less likely it is that any one of them will intervene. As with any experiment, they needed to vary the critical aspect of the situation that they thought would have a causal effect, in their case the number of people who wit- nessed an emergency. This is called the <b>independent variable</b>, which is the variable a re- searcher changes or varies to see if it has an effect on some other variable. The researcher then observes whether the independent variable (e.g., the number of bystanders) has the predicted effect on the outcome of interest, namely the <b>dependent variable</b><a href="#bookmark52" class="a">, which is the variable a researcher measures to see if it is influenced by the independent variable—in this case whether people help in an emergency (see </a>Figure 2.2).</p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">Sound simple? Actually, it isn’t. Staging an experiment to test Latané and Darley’s hypothesis about the effects of group size involves severe practical and eth- ical difficulties. What kind of emergency should be used? Ideally (from a scientific perspective), it should be as true to the Genovese case as possible. Accordingly, you would want to stage a murder that passersby could witness. In one condition, you could stage the murder so that only a few onlookers were present; in another condi- tion, you could stage it so that a great many onlookers were present.</p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">Obviously, no scientist in his or her right mind would stage a murder for unsus- pecting bystanders. But how could the researchers arrange a realistic situation that is upsetting enough to be similar to the Genovese case without it being too upsetting? In addition, how could they ensure that each bystander experienced the same emer- gency except for the independent variable whose effect they wanted to test—namely, the number of bystanders?</p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">Let’s see how Latané and Darley (1968) dealt with these problems. Imagine that you are a participant in their experiment. You arrive at the scheduled time and find yourself in a long corridor with doors to several small rooms. An experimenter greets you and takes you into one of the rooms, mentioning that five other students, seated out of view in the other rooms, will be participating with you. The experi- menter leaves after giving you a pair of headphones with an attached microphone. You put on the headphones, and soon you hear the experimenter explaining to ev- eryone that he is interested in learning about the kinds of personal problems college students experience.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 358pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark52">&zwnj;</a>Methodology: How Social Psychologists Do Research <span class="h4">57</span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="475" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_063.png"/></span></p><h3 style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">Figure 2.2 <span class="s29">Researchers vary the independent variable (e.g., the number of bystanders people think are present) and observe what effect that has on the dependent variable (e.g., whether people help).</span></h3><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><table style="border-collapse:collapse;margin-left:97.312pt" cellspacing="0"><tr style="height:18pt"><td style="width:152pt;border-top-style:solid;border-top-width:1pt;border-top-color:#231F20;border-left-style:solid;border-left-width:1pt;border-left-color:#231F20;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:1pt;border-bottom-color:#231F20;border-right-style:solid;border-right-width:1pt;border-right-color:#231F20" colspan="4"><p class="s62" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Independent Variable</p></td><td style="width:140pt;border-top-style:solid;border-top-width:1pt;border-top-color:#231F20;border-left-style:solid;border-left-width:1pt;border-left-color:#231F20;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:1pt;border-bottom-color:#231F20;border-right-style:solid;border-right-width:1pt;border-right-color:#231F20"><p class="s62" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 1pt;padding-right: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Dependent Variable</p></td></tr><tr style="height:56pt"><td style="width:152pt;border-top-style:solid;border-top-width:1pt;border-top-color:#231F20;border-left-style:solid;border-left-width:1pt;border-left-color:#231F20;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:1pt;border-bottom-color:#231F20;border-right-style:solid;border-right-width:1pt;border-right-color:#231F20" colspan="4"><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="389" height="322" alt="image" src="Image_064.png"/></span></p><p class="s63" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The variable that is hypothesized</p><p class="s63" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">to influence the dependent variable.

remain anonymous and each will stay in his or her separate room and communicate with the others only via the intercom system. The experimenter further says that the discussion will be recorded, but to encourage openness, he will not listen to it “live.” Finally, the experimenter asks participants to take turns presenting their problems, each speaking for 2 minutes, after which each person will comment on what the others have said. To make sure this procedure is followed, he says, only one per- son’s microphone will be turned on at a time.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">The group discussion begins.

When his 2 minutes are up, you hear the other four participants discuss their problems; then it is your turn. When you have finished, the first person speaks again.

In these conditions, the procedure was identical to the one we described, with one crucial difference: The size of the discussion group was smaller, meaning that fewer people witnessed the seizure. In one condition, the participants were told that there were three other people in the discussion group besides themselves (the victim plus two others), and in this case, helping behavior increased to 62%. In a third con- dition, participants were told that there was only one other person in their discussion group (the victim), and in that case, nearly everyone helped (85%; see </a>Figure 2.2).</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">These results indicate that the number of bystanders strongly influences the rate of helping, but it does not mean that the size of the group is the only cause of people’s de- cision to help. After all, when there were four bystanders, a third of the participants still helped; conversely, when participants thought they were the only witness, some of them failed to do so. Obviously, other factors influence helping behavior—the bystanders’ personalities, their prior experience with emergencies, and so on. Nonetheless, Latané and Darley succeeded in identifying one important determinant of whether people help: the number of bystanders that people think are present.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s4">INTERNAL VALIDITY IN EXPERIMENTS  </span><span class="p">How can we be sure that the differences in help across conditions in the Latané and Darley seizure study were due to the different numbers of bystanders who witnessed the emergency?

Maybe the observed differences in helping were due to characteristics of the participants instead of the independent variable. The people in the sole-witness condition might have differed in any number of ways from their counterparts in the other conditions, making them more likely to help. Maybe they</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="415" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_065.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="415" height="224" alt="image" src="Image_066.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 180pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">were more likely to know something about ep- ilepsy or to have experience helping in emer- gencies. If either of these possibilities is true, it would be difficult to conclude that it was the number of bystanders, rather than something about the participants’ backgrounds, that led to differences in helping.</p><p style="padding-left: 180pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">Fortunately, there is a technique that al- lows experimenters to minimize differences among participants as the cause of the re- sults: <b>random assignment to condition</b>. This is the process whereby all participants have an equal chance of taking part in any con- dition of an experiment; through random assignment, researchers can be relatively certain that differences in the participants’</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 358pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark38">&zwnj;</a>Methodology: How Social Psychologists Do Research <span class="h4">59</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">personalities or backgrounds are distributed evenly across conditions. Because Latané and Darley’s participants were randomly assigned to the conditions of their experi- ment, it is very unlikely that the ones who knew the most about epilepsy all ended up in one condition. Knowledge about epilepsy should be randomly (i.e., roughly evenly) dispersed across the three experimental conditions. This powerful technique is the most important part of the experimental method.</p><p style="padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">Even with random assignment, however, there is the (very small) possibility that different characteristics of people did not distribute themselves evenly across condi- tions. For example, if we randomly divide a group of 40 people into two groups, it is possible that those who know the most about epilepsy will by chance end up more in one group than in the other—just as it is possible to get more heads than tails when you flip a coin 40 times. This is a possibility we take seriously in experimental science. The analyses of our data come with a <b>probability level (</b><i><b>p</b></i><b>-value)</b>, which is a num- ber, calculated with statistical techniques, that tells researchers how likely it is that the results of their experiment occurred by chance and not because of the independent variable. The convention in science, including social psychology, is to consider results <span class="s23">significant </span>(trustworthy) if the probability level is less than 5 in 100 that the results might be due to chance factors rather than the independent variables studied. For ex- ample, if we flipped a coin 40 times and got 40 heads, we would probably assume that this was very unlikely to have occurred by chance and that there was something wrong with the coin (we might check the other side to make sure it wasn’t one of those trick coins with heads on both sides!). Similarly, if the results in two conditions of an experiment differ significantly from what we would expect by chance, we assume that the difference was caused by the independent variable (e.g., the number of bystanders present during the emergency). The <span class="s23">p</span>-value tells us how confident we can be that the difference was due to chance rather than the independent variable.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">To summarize, the key to a good experiment is to maintain high <b>internal validity</b>, which we can now define as making sure that the independent variable, and <span class="s23">only </span>the inde- pendent variable, influences the dependent variable. This is accomplished by controlling all extraneous variables and by randomly assigning people to different experimental con- ditions (Campbell &amp; Stanley, 1967). When internal validity is high, the experimenter is in a position to judge whether the independent variable causes the dependent variable. This is the hallmark of the experimental method that sets it apart from the observational and correlational methods: Only the experimental method can answer causal questions, such as whether exposure to pornography causes men to commit violent acts.</p><p style="padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">For example, researchers have tested whether pornography causes aggression by randomly assigning consenting participants to watch pornographic or nonpornographic films (the independent variable) and measuring the extent to which people acted aggres- sively toward women (the dependent variable). In a study by Donnerstein and Berkowitz (1981), males were angered by a female accomplice and then were randomly assigned to see one of three films: violent pornography (a rape scene), nonviolent pornography (sex without any violence), or a neutral film with no violence or sex (a talk show interview). The men were then given an opportunity to act aggressively toward the woman who had angered them, by choosing the level of electric shock she would receive in an ostensibly unrelated learning experiment (the accomplice did not really receive shocks, but partici- pants believed that she would). The men who had seen the violent pornography admin- istered significantly more intense shocks to the woman than did the men who had seen the nonviolent pornography or the neutral film, suggesting that it is not pornography per se that leads to aggressive behavior, but the violence depicted in some pornography (Mussweiler &amp; Förster, 2000). We review this area of research in more detail in Chapter 12.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">EXTERNAL VALIDITY IN EXPERIMENTS  <span class="p">For all the advantages of the experimen- tal method, there are some drawbacks.

For example, it might be argued that Latané and Darley strayed far from the original inspiration for their study, the Kitty Genovese murder. What does witnessing a seizure while participating in a laboratory experiment in a college building have to do with a brutal murder in a densely populated urban neighborhood? How often in everyday life do we have discussions with other people through an intercom system? Did the fact that the participants knew they were in a psychology experiment influ- ence their behavior?</p><p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">These are important questions that concern <b>external validity</b>, which is the extent to which the results of a study can be generalized to other situations and other people. Note that two kinds of generalizability are at issue: the extent to which we can gener- alize from the situation constructed by an experimenter to real-life situations, referred to as generalizability across <span class="s23">situations</span>, and the extent to which we can generalize from the people who participated in the experiment to people in general, referred to as gen- eralizability across <span class="s23">people</span>.</p><p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">When it comes to generalizability across situations, research in social psy- chology is sometimes criticized for being conducted in artificial settings that cannot be generalized to real life—for example, psychological experiments at a university. To address this problem, social psychologists attempt to increase the generalizability of their results by making their studies as realistic as possible. But this is hard to do in a laboratory setting in which people are placed in sit- uations they would rarely, if ever, encounter in everyday life, such as occurred in Latané and Darley’s group discussion of personal problems over an intercom system. Instead, psychologists attempt to maximize the study’s <b>psychological realism</b>, which is the extent to which the psychological processes triggered in an experiment are similar to psychological processes that occur in everyday life (Aronson, Wilson, &amp; Brewer, 1998). Even though Latané and Darley staged an emergency that in significant ways was unlike those encountered in everyday life, was it psychologically similar to real-life emergencies? Were the same psycholog- ical processes triggered? Did the participants have the same types of perceptions and thoughts, make the same types of decisions, and choose the same types of behaviors that they would in a real-life situation? If so, the study is high in psy- chological realism and we can generalize the results to everyday life.</p><p style="padding-left: 167pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Psychological realism is heightened if peo-</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="422" height="301" alt="image" src="Image_067.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A good deal of social psychological research takes place in laboratory settings. How do social psychologists generalize from the findings of these studies to life outside the laboratory?</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">ple feel involved in a real event. To accomplish this, experimenters often tell participants a <b>cover story</b>—a disguised version of the study’s true pur- pose. Recall, for example, that Latané and Darley told people that they were studying the personal problems of college students and then staged an emergency. It would have been a lot easier to say to people, “Look, we are interested in how peo- ple react to emergencies, so at some point during this study we are going to stage an accident, and then we’ll see how you respond.” We think you’ll agree that such a procedure would be very low in psychological realism. In real life, we never know when emergencies are going to occur, and we do not have time to plan our responses to them. If participants knew that an emergency was about to happen, the kinds of psychological processes trig- gered would have been quite different from those of a real emergency, reducing the psychological re- alism of the study.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 358pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark39">&zwnj;</a>Methodology: How Social Psychologists Do Research <span class="h4">61</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">Social psychologists are also concerned with generalizability across people. Latané and Darley’s experiment, for example, documented an interesting, unexpected exam- ple of social influence whereby the mere knowledge that others were present reduced the likelihood that people helped. But what have we learned about people in gen- eral? The participants in their study were 52 male and female students at New York University who received course credit for participating in the experiment. Would the study have turned out the same way if a different population had been used? Would the number of bystanders have influenced helping behavior had the participants been middle-aged blue-collar workers instead of college students? Midwesterners instead of New Yorkers? Japanese instead of American?</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">The only way to be certain that the results of an experiment represent the behav- ior of a particular population is to ensure that the participants are randomly selected from that population. Ideally, samples in experiments should be randomly selected, just as they are in surveys. Increasingly, social psychologists are conducting research with diverse populations and cultures, some of it over the internet (e.g., Lane, Banaji, &amp; Nosek, 2007). But, unfortunately, it is impractical and expensive to select random samples for most social psychology experiments. It is difficult enough to convince a random sample of Americans to agree to answer a few questions over the telephone as part of a political poll, and such polls can cost thousands of dollars to conduct. Imagine the difficulty Latané and Darley would have had convincing a random sam- ple of Americans to board a plane to New York to take part in their study, not to men- tion the cost of such an endeavor. Even trying to gather a random sample of students at New York University would not have been easy; each person contacted would have had to agree to spend an hour in Latané and Darley’s laboratory.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">However, concerns about practicality and expense are not good excuses for doing poor science. Many researchers address this problem by studying basic psychological processes that make people susceptible to social influence, assuming that these processes are so fundamental that they are universally shared. In that case, participants for social psychology experiments don’t really have to come from all over the country or world. Of course, some social psychological processes are likely to be quite dependent on cul- tural factors, and in those cases, we’d need diverse samples of people. The question then is, how can researchers tell whether the processes they are studying are universal?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;"><span class="s4">FIELD EXPERIMENTS  </span>One of the best ways to increase external validity is by con- ducting <b>field experiments</b>. In a field experiment, researchers study behavior outside the laboratory, in its natural setting. As in a laboratory experiment, the researcher controls the occurrence of an independent variable (e.g., group size) to see what ef- fect it has on a dependent variable (e.g., helping behavior) and randomly assigns people to the different conditions. Thus, a field experiment has the same design as a laboratory experiment, except that it is conducted in a real-life setting rather than in the relatively artificial setting of the laboratory. The participants in a field experiment are unaware that the events they experience are in fact an experiment. The external validity of such an experiment is high, because, after all, it is taking place in the real world, with real people who are more diverse than a typical college student sample. Many such field studies have been conducted in social psychology. For example, Latané and Darley (1970) tested their hypothesis about group size and bystander in- tervention in a convenience store outside New York City. Two “robbers” (with full knowledge and permission of the cashier and manager of the store) waited at the checkout counter until there were either one or two other customers approaching to get in line. They then asked the cashier to retrieve the most expensive beer the store carried. The cashier said he would have to check in the back to see how much of that brand was in stock. While the cashier was gone, the robbers picked up a case of beer in the front of the store, declared, “They’ll never miss this,” put the beer in their car,</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">and drove off.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">Field Experiments <span class="s19">Experiments conducted in nat- ural settings rather than in the</span></p><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">laboratory</p><h4 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark40">&zwnj;</a>62 <span class="s6">Chapter 2</span></h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="336" height="223" alt="image" src="Image_068.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Some experiments are done in a psychology laboratory, whereas others are done in real-life settings. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each approach?</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">Because the robbers were rather burly fellows, no one attempted to intervene directly to stop the theft. The question was, when the cashier returned, how many people would help by telling him that a theft had just occurred? As it turned out, the number of bystanders had the same inhibiting effect on helping behavior as in the laboratory seizure study: Significantly fewer people reported the theft when there was another customer- witness in the store than when they were alone.</p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: justify;">It might have occurred to you to ask why researchers conduct laboratory studies at all, given that external va- lidity is so much better with field experiments. Indeed, it seems to us that the perfect experiment in social psychol- ogy would be one that was conducted in a field setting with a sample randomly selected from a population of in- terest and with extremely high internal validity (all extra- neous variables controlled, people randomly assigned to</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Basic Dilemma of the Social Psychologist</p><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 128%;text-align: left;">The trade-off between internal and external validity in conducting research; it is very difficult to do one experiment that is both high in internal validity and generaliz- able to other situations and people</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Replications</p><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 128%;text-align: left;">Repeating a study, often with different subject populations or in different settings</p><p class="s18" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Meta-Analysis</p><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 128%;text-align: left;">A statistical technique that averages the results of two or more studies to see if the effect of an in- dependent variable is reliable</p><p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">the conditions). Sounds good, doesn’t it? The only problem is that it is very difficult to satisfy all these conditions in one study, making such studies virtually impossible to conduct.</p><p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">There is almost always a trade-off between internal and external validity—that is, between being able to randomly assign people to conditions and having enough control over the situation to ensure that no extraneous variables are influencing the results, and making sure that the results can be generalized to everyday life. We have the most control in a laboratory setting, but the laboratory may be unlike real life. Real life can best be captured by doing a field experiment, but it is very difficult to control all extraneous variables in such studies. For example, the astute reader will have noticed that Latané and Darley’s (1970) beer theft study differed from labora- tory experiments in an important way: People could not be randomly assigned to the alone or in-pairs conditions. Were this the only study Latané and Darley had per- formed, we could not be sure whether the kinds of people who prefer to shop alone, as compared to the kinds of people who prefer to shop with a friend, differ in ways that might influence helping behavior. By randomly assigning people to conditions in their laboratory studies, Latané and Darley were able to rule out such alternative explanations.</p><p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">The trade-off between internal and external validity has been referred to as the <b>basic dilemma of the social psychologist </b>(Aronson &amp; Carlsmith, 1968). The way to resolve this dilemma is not to try to do it all in a single experiment. Most social psy- chologists opt first for internal validity, conducting laboratory experiments in which people are randomly assigned to different conditions and all extraneous variables are controlled; here there is little ambiguity about what is causing what. Other social psy- chologists prefer to maximize external validity by conducting field studies. And many social psychologists do both. Taken together, both types of studies meet the require- ments of our perfect experiment.</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s4">REPLICATIONS AND META-ANALYSIS  </span><b>Replications </b>are the ultimate test of an experiment’s external validity. Only by conducting studies in different settings, with different populations, can we determine how generalizable the results are. Often, though, when many studies on one problem are conducted, the results are somewhat variable. Several studies might find an effect of the number of bystanders on helping behavior, for example, while a few do not. How can we make sense of this? Does the number of bystanders make a difference or not? Fortunately, there is a statistical tech- nique called <b>meta-analysis </b>that averages the results of two or more studies to see if the effect of an independent variable is reliable.

There are several reasons for people, especially Asians, to adopt Anglo names while living in a foreign country, including to communicate better with their majority group members, demonstrate fondness for the culture, facilitate social bonding, among others. But as it turns out, this practice might also have negative consequences for minorities and their self-esteem. Consider this research study done by two researchers at University of Kansas that investigated the psychological correlational variables of adopting Anglo names. The researchers hypothesized that Chinese students who adopt Anglo names may report lower levels of self-esteem. They conducted two separate studies that used similar procedures (with 109 and 231 participants, respectively) wherein Chinese college students studying in the U.S. were asked to complete a battery of questionnaires regarding adoption of Anglo names, self- esteem, mental and physical health, and well-being. Both studies produced similar results: First, participants were more likely to use an Anglo name if they believed that Americans would have a hard time pronouncing and remembering their Chinese name. Second, participants who adopted an Anglo name reported a slightly lower level of self-esteem. Third, choosing to use an Anglo name had no impact on reported levels of physical health, mental health, and subjective well-being (Zhao &amp; Biernat, 2018).</p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 83pt;text-indent: 18pt;line-height: 123%;text-align: justify;">If you’re an Asian student and have adopted an Anglo name, you may be thinking “Whoa, maybe I should start using my original name.” And that is one possible implication of this study. However,</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 123%;text-align: justify;">we hope that after reading this chapter a sign is flashing on and off in your head that says, “Not so fast! Correlation does not equal causation!” Indeed, the study couldn’t determine if using the Anglo name caused self-esteem to drop—rather it only proved that the two variables (international students Anglicizing their names and them reporting lower self-esteem) were correlated in a statistically significant manner. Any observed association represents a case of bidirectional possibility here, in the sense that we cannot be sure whether it is the adoption of an Anglo name that causes lower self- esteem, or the other way around. For example, on the one hand, it is possible that the practice of adopting Anglo names causes lower self-esteem because those who adopt this practice may experience a loss in cultural identity. On the other hand, it is equally possible that people with low self-esteem chose to adopt Anglo names as a strategy to better assimilate with the host culture. Without causal evidence, both possibilities can be true and there is also the possible existence of a third variable such as perceived social rejection, which causes people to have low self-esteem and adopt an Anglo name.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 18pt;line-height: 123%;text-align: justify;">That said, correlational studies are still very valuable in helping us understand a wide variety of phenomena that cannot be experimentally manipulated. A carefully designed correlational study can generate solid claims about the relationships between different variables. But in this case, the solution is clear: college teachers and students should make a greater effort to learn and pronounce foreign names, thereby reducing the need for international students to adopt an Anglicized, artificial version of their real names and hence, their identity.</p><p style="padding-top: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">us the probability that the findings of one study are due to chance or to the independent variable. A meta-analysis essentially does the same thing, except that it averages the results of many different studies. If, say, an independent variable is found to have an effect in only 1 of 20 studies, the meta-analysis will tell us that that one study was probably an exception and that, on average, the independent variable is not influencing the dependent variable. If an independent variable is having an effect in most of the studies, the meta-analysis is likely to tell us that, on average, it does influence the dependent variable.</p><p style="padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">Most of the findings you will read about in this book have been replicated in several different settings, with different populations; we know, then, that they are reli- able phenomena, not limited to the laboratory or to college sophomores. For example, Anderson and Bushman (1997) compared laboratory studies on the causes of aggression with studies conducted in the real world. In both types of studies, violence in the media caused aggressive behavior. Similarly, Latané and Darley’s original findings have been replicated in numerous studies. Increasing the number of bystanders inhibited helping behavior with many kinds of people, including children, college students, and future ministers (Darley &amp; Batson, 1973; Latané &amp; Nida, 1981; Plötner et al., 2015); in both small towns and large cities (Latané &amp; Dabbs, 1975); in a variety of settings, such as psychology laboratories, city streets, and subway trains (Harrison &amp; Wells, 1991; Latané &amp; Darley, 1970; Piliavin &amp; Piliavin, 1972); and with different kinds of emergencies, such as seizures, potential fires, fights, and accidents (Latané &amp; Darley, 1968; Shotland &amp; Straw, 1976; Staub, 1974), as well as with less-serious events, such as having a flat tire (Hurley &amp; Allen, 1974). Many of these replications took place in real-life settings (e.g., on a subway train) where people could not possibly have known that an experiment was being conducted.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark42">&zwnj;</a>64 <span class="s6">Chapter 2</span></h4><p style="padding-top: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 188pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">That said, sometimes replications fail to confirm the findings of a particular study. The question of how replicable findings are in social psychology and other sciences has become a topic of debate, with some arguing that too many studies in psychology have failed to replicate and that our methods need to be improved to make sure that research findings of studies are reliable and replicable (Open Science Collaboration, 2015). Others argue that while scientific methods can always be improved, and that there have been healthy steps in that direction, there is no evidence of a “replication crisis” (Gilbert, King, Pettigrew, &amp; Wilson, 2016). Readers can be assured that most of the areas of research dis- cussed in this book have been replicated. There are cases in which specific findings have been called into question, however, and when that is the case we will point that out.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Basic Research</p><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 128%;text-align: left;">Studies that are designed to find the best answer to the question of why people behave as they do and that are conducted purely for rea- sons of intellectual curiosity</p><p class="s18" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Applied Research</p><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 128%;text-align: left;">Studies designed to solve a partic- ular social problem</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">BASIC VERSUS APPLIED RESEARCH  <span class="p">You may have wondered how people decide which specific topic to study. Why would a social psychologist decide to study helping behavior, cognitive dissonance theory, or the effects of pornography on aggression? Is he or she simply curious? Or does the social psychologist have a specific purpose in mind, such as trying to reduce sexual violence?</span></p><p style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">The goal in <b>basic research </b>is to find the best answer to the question of why people behave as they do, purely for reasons of intellectual curiosity. The researchers aren’t trying to solve a specific social or psychological problem. In contrast, <b>applied research </b>is geared toward solving a particular social problem. Here, building a theory of be- havior is usually secondary to solving the specific problem, such as alleviating racism, reducing sexual violence, or stemming the spread of AIDS.</p><p style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">In social psychology, the distinction between basic and applied research is fuzzy. Even though many researchers label themselves as either basic or applied scientists, the endeav- ors of one group are not independent of those of the other group. There are countless ex- amples of advances in basic science that at the time had no known applied value but later proved to be the key to solving a significant applied problem. As we will see later in this book, for example, basic research with dogs, rats, and fish on the effects of feeling in control of one’s environment has led to the development of techniques to improve the health of elderly nursing home residents (Langer &amp; Rodin, 1976; Richter, 1957; Schulz, 1976).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="681" height="352" alt="image" src="Image_070.png"/></span></p><p class="s21" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Review Questions</p><ol id="l45"><li data-list-text="1."><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 71pt;text-indent: -11pt;text-align: left;">Which kind of study is best suited to ethnography?</p><ol id="l46"><li data-list-text="a."><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 84pt;text-indent: -12pt;line-height: 121%;text-align: left;">A study of what factors cause Greenpeace activists to commit to their ideals.</p></li><li data-list-text="b."><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 84pt;text-indent: -12pt;line-height: 121%;text-align: left;">A study to see if violent videogames cause children to act more violently.</p></li><li data-list-text="c."><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 84pt;text-indent: -12pt;line-height: 121%;text-align: left;">A study to see if people are more likely to litter in a place that already has been littered.</p></li><li data-list-text="d."><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 84pt;text-indent: -12pt;line-height: 121%;text-align: left;">A study examining posts on Twitter to see how people’s moods fluctuate throughout the day.</p></li></ol></li><li data-list-text="2."><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 72pt;text-indent: -12pt;line-height: 121%;text-align: left;">Why is it important to establish interjudge reliability in an observational study?</p><ol id="l47"><li data-list-text="a."><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 83pt;text-indent: -11pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">To make sure the observations are more empirical.</p></li><li data-list-text="b."><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 83pt;text-indent: -11pt;text-align: left;">To make sure the observations are subjective.</p></li><li data-list-text="c."><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 84pt;text-indent: -12pt;line-height: 121%;text-align: left;">To make sure the observations are not subjective and have not been distorted by one person.</p></li><li data-list-text="d."><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 83pt;text-indent: -11pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">To resolve disputes between researchers.</p></li></ol></li><li data-list-text="3."><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 72pt;text-indent: -12pt;line-height: 121%;text-align: left;">Social psychology uses three main methods for answering questions about social behavior.

Indeed, Kurt Lewin (1951), one of the founders of social psychology, coined a phrase that has become a motto for the field: “There is nothing so practical as a good theory” (p. 169). He meant that to solve such difficult social problems as urban violence or racial prejudice, one must first understand the underlying psychological dynamics of human nature and social interaction. Even when the goal is to discover the psychological processes un- derlying social behavior, the findings often have clear applied implications, as you’ll see throughout this book. For example, basic research on how people understand and construe the world has been translated into successful attempts to address many prob- lems, including closing the achievement gap in education, reducing prejudice, reducing teenage pregnancies, and lowering the rate of child abuse (Wilson, 2011; Walton, 2014).</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: left;">New Frontiers in Social Psychological Research</p><p class="s16" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 102pt;text-indent: -40pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">LO 2.3  <span class="s17">Explain the impact cross-cultural studies and social neuroscience research have on the way in which scientists investigate social behavior.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Social psychologists are always looking for new ways of investigating social behavior, and in recent years some exciting new methods and approaches have been developed. These methodological advances have been spurred on by new questions about the origins of social behavior, because new questions and new methods often develop hand in hand.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s24" style="padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Culture and Social Psychology</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Social psychology largely began as a Western science, conducted by Western social psychologists with Western participants. This raises the question of how univer- sal the findings are. To study the effects of culture on social psychological pro- cess, social psychologists conduct <b>cross-cultural research </b>(Gelfand, Chiu, &amp; Hong,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">Cross-Cultural Research <span class="s19">Research conducted with mem- bers of different cultures, to see</span></p><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">whether the psychological pro-</p><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 128%;text-align: left;">cesses of interest are present in both cultures or whether they are specific to the culture in which people were raised</p><h4 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark45">&zwnj;</a>66 <span class="s6">Chapter 2</span></h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="224" height="335" alt="image" src="Image_072.jpg"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Some basic psychological processes are universal, whereas others are shaped by the culture in which we live. For example, are people’s self-concepts shaped by cultural rules of how people must present themselves, such as the requirement by the Taliban regime in Afghanistan that women cover themselves from head to toe? Cross-cultural research is challenging but necessary for exploring how culture influences the basic ways in which people think about and interact with others. We will see many other examples of cross-cultural research later in this book.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">2014; Heine, 2010; Kitayama &amp; Cohen, 2007; Morling, 2016; Wang, 2016; Nisbett, 2003). Some findings in social psychology are culture-dependent, as we will see throughout this book. In Chapter 3, for example, we will see that Westerners and East Asians rely on fundamentally different kinds of thought to perceive and understand the social world. In Chapter 5, we’ll discuss cultural differences in the very way people define themselves. Whether we emphasize personal independence or social interdependence reflects our cultural values (Henrich, Heine, &amp; Norenzayan, 2010).</p><p style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">Conducting cross-cultural research is not simply a matter of traveling to another culture, translating materials into the local language, and replicat- ing a study there (Heine et al., 2002; Davidov et al., 2014). Researchers have to guard against imposing their own viewpoints and definitions, learned from their culture, onto another culture with which they are unfamiliar. They must also be sure that their independent and dependent variables are understood in the same way in different cultures (Bond, 1988; Lonner &amp; Berry, 1986).</p><p style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">Suppose, for example, that you wanted to replicate the Latané and Darley (1968) seizure experiment in another culture. Clearly, you could not conduct the identical experiment somewhere else. The tape-recorded discussion of college life used by Latané and Darley was specific to the lives of New York University students in the 1960s and could not be used meaningfully elsewhere. What about more subtle aspects of the study, such as the way people viewed the person who had the seizure? Cultures vary considerably in how they define whether or not another person belongs to their social group; this factor figures significantly in how they behave toward that person (Gudykunst, 1988; Triandis, 1989). If peo- ple in one culture view the victim as a member of their social group but peo- ple in another culture perceive the victim as a member of a rival social group, you might find very different results in the two cultures—not because the psy- chological processes of helping behavior are different, but because people in- terpreted the situation differently. It can be quite daunting to conduct a study that is interpreted and perceived similarly in dissimilar cultures. Cross-cultural researchers are sensitive to these issues, and as more and more cross-cultural research is conducted carefully, we will be able to determine which social psy-</p><p style="padding-left: 188pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">chological processes are universal and which are culture-bound (Heine, 2010). For ex- ample, there is substantial evidence that playing violent video games makes people act in more aggressive ways and makes them less likely to help others.

Most research studies in social psychology, then, study just that—thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Human beings are biological organisms, however, and social psychologists have become increasingly interested in the connection be- tween biological processes and social behavior. These in- terests include the study of hormones and behavior, the human immune system, and neurological processes in the human brain.

Social psychologists take these measurements while participants think about and process social information, allowing them to correlate different kinds of brain activity with social information processing. This kind of research promises to open up a whole new area of inquiry into the rela- tionship of the brain to behavior (Cacioppo &amp; Cacioppo, 2013; Coan &amp; Maresh, 2014; Connelly &amp; Morris, 2016; Lieberman, 2013; Ochsner, 2007; Varnum, 2016).</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="681" height="255" alt="image" src="Image_074.png"/></span></p><p class="s21" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 84pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Review Questions</p><ol id="l54"><li data-list-text="1."><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 96pt;text-indent: -12pt;line-height: 121%;text-align: left;">What is the goal of cross-cultural research in social psychology?</p><ol id="l55"><li data-list-text="a."><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 108pt;text-indent: -12pt;line-height: 121%;text-align: left;">To find out which social psychological processes are dictated by culture and which are universal.</p></li><li data-list-text="b."><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 108pt;text-indent: -12pt;line-height: 121%;text-align: left;">To answer questions like whether violent video games are destroying cultures.</p></li><li data-list-text="c."><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 107pt;text-indent: -11pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">To rank or compare cultures.</p></li><li data-list-text="d."><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 108pt;text-indent: -12pt;line-height: 121%;text-align: left;">To find out if all social psychological processes are dictated by culture.</p></li></ol></li><li data-list-text="2."><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 95pt;text-indent: -11pt;text-align: left;">What is the goal of social neuroscience?</p><ol id="l56"><li data-list-text="a."><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 108pt;text-indent: -12pt;line-height: 121%;text-align: left;">To legitimize social psychology as a science through the use of machines such as EEGs and fMRIs.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="b."><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: -12pt;line-height: 122%;text-align: left;">To settle debates in social psychology, such as whether a social process is caused by brain structure or culture.</p></li><li data-list-text="c."><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: -12pt;line-height: 122%;text-align: left;">To explore how different kinds of brain activity correlate with social information processing by having participants think about a social situation and evaluat- ing which parts of the brain are involved.</p></li><li data-list-text="d."><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: -12pt;line-height: 122%;text-align: left;">To see if social processes can happen without other people being present by having participants think about a social situation and evaluating which parts of the brain are involved.</p></li></ol></li></ol><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ethical Issues in Social Psychology</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="316" height="372" alt="image" src="Image_075.gif"/></span></p><p class="s16" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 102pt;text-indent: -40pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">LO 2.4  <span class="s17">Summarize how social psychologists ensure the safety and welfare of their research participants, while at the same time testing hypotheses about the causes of social behavior.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">As you read this chapter, did it bother you to learn that re- searchers sometimes mislead people about the true purpose of their study or that, in Latané and Darley’s seizure study, people were put in a situation that might have been upset- ting? In their quest to create realistic, engaging situations, social psychologists frequently face ethical dilemmas. For sci- entific reasons, we want our experiments to resemble the real world as much as possible and to be as sound and well con- trolled as we can make them. But we also want to avoid caus- ing our participants stress, discomfort, or unpleasantness. These two goals sometimes conflict as the researcher goes about the business of creating and conducting experiments.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">Above all, researchers are concerned about the health and welfare of the individuals participating in their experiments. Researchers are also in the process of discovering important information about human social behavior, such as bystander intervention, prejudice, conformity, aggression, and obe- dience to authority. Many of these discoveries are bound to benefit society. Indeed, given the fact that social psychologists have developed powerful tools to investigate such issues sci- entifically, many scholars feel it would be immoral not to con-</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">duct experiments to explore them. To gain insight into such</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="https://ScienceCartoonsPlus.com/" class="s69">ScienceCartoonsPlus.com</a></p><h4 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">68 <span class="s6">Chapter 2</span></h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Informed Consent</p><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 128%;text-align: left;">Agreement to participate in an experiment, granted in full aware- ness of the nature of the experi- ment, which has been explained in advance</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Deception</p><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 128%;text-align: left;">Misleading participants about the true purpose of a study or the events that will actually transpire</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Debriefing</p><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 128%;text-align: left;">Explaining to participants, at the end of an experiment, the true purpose of the study and exactly what transpired</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">critical issues, however, researchers often must create events that are vivid and engag- ing for the participants. Some of these events might make the participants uncomfort- able, such as witnessing someone having a seizure. We can’t resolve the dilemma by making pious claims that participants never experience discomfort in an experiment or by insisting that all is fair in science and then forging blindly ahead. Clearly, some middle ground is called for.</p><p style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">The dilemma is less problematic if researchers can obtain <b>informed consent </b>from their participants prior to their participation. To obtain informed consent, the researcher explains the nature of the experiment to participants before it begins and asks for their permission to participate. If participants are made fully aware of the kinds of experiences they are about to undergo and state that they are willing to par- ticipate, the ethical dilemma is resolved. In many social psychology experiments, this sort of description is feasible—and where it is feasible, it is done. For example, one of the authors of this text was interested in how college students would react if they were left alone with their thoughts for 15 minutes, without access to their phones or any other external distractions. Might they get so bored that they would administer to themselves a mild electric shock to relieve their boredom? To find out we asked peo- ple whether they would be willing to receive mild electric shocks in the study, and all participants gave their informed consent to do so. (As it happened, two-thirds of men and a quarter of women chose to shock themselves at least once; Wilson et al., 2014).</p><p style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">But sometimes it is not possible to inform people exactly what will happen in advance. Suppose Latané and Darley had told their participants that a seizure was about to be staged, that it wouldn’t be a real emergency, and that the point was to see if they offered help. Such a procedure would be bad science. In this kind of experiment, it’s essential that the participant experience contrived events as if they were real; this is called a <span class="s23">deception experiment</span>. <b>Deception </b>in social psychological research involves misleading participants about the true purpose of a study or the events that transpire. Psychologists use deception only if it is the only way in which they can test a hypoth- esis about social behavior.</p><p style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: right;">When deception is used in a study, the postexperimental interview, called the <span class="s23">debrief- ing session</span>, is crucial. <b>Debriefing </b>is the process of explaining to the participants, at the end of an experiment, the true purpose of the study and exactly what transpired. If any participants have experienced discomfort, the researchers attempt to undo and alleviate it. During debriefing too the participants learn about the goals and purpose of the re- search. The best researchers question their participants carefully and listen to what they say, regardless of whether or not deception was used in the experiment. (For a detailed description of how debriefing interviews should be conducted, see Aronson et al., 1990.)</p><p style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">In our experience, virtually all participants understand and appreciate the need for deception, as long as the time is taken in the postexperimental debriefing session to review the purpose of the research and to explain why alternative procedures could not be used. Several investigators have gone a step further and assessed the impact on people of participating in deception studies (e.g., Christensen, 1988; Epley &amp; Huff, 1998; Finney, 1987; Gerdes, 1979; Sharpe, Adair, &amp; Roese, 1992). These studies have consistently found that people do not object to the kinds of mild discomfort and decep- tions typically used in social psychological research. In fact, some studies have found that most people who participated in deception experiments reported learning more and enjoying the experiments more than did those who participated in nondeception experiments (Smith &amp; Richardson, 1983). For example, Latané and Darley (1970) re- ported that, during their debriefing, the participants said that the deception was nec- essary and that they were willing to participate in similar studies in the future—even though they had experienced some stress and conflict during the study.</p><p style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: justify;">To ensure that the dignity and safety of research participants are protected, the American Psychological Association (2010) has published a list of ethical principles</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 358pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark53">&zwnj;</a>Methodology: How Social Psychologists Do Research <span class="h4">69</span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="625" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_076.png"/></span></p><h3 style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: left;">Figure 2.3 <span class="s29">The American Psychological Association, a professional organization that represents psychology in the United States, has established ethical guidelines that psychological researchers are expected to follow.

Experiments should be high in <span class="s23">internal validity</span>, which means that people in all conditions are treated identically, except for the independent variable (e.g., how much TV chil- dren watch). <span class="s23">External validity</span>—the extent to which researchers can generalize their results to other sit- uations and people—is accomplished by increas- ing the realism of the experiment, particularly its psychological realism (the extent to which the psy- chological processes triggered in the experiment are similar to those triggered in everyday life).
